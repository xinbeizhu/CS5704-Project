If you still prefer HTTP checkout the app \"Tasmota control\".", "accepted_answer": "I am not an expert on the topic but have tried a few things and got some insight for you on why to prefer MQTT over HTTP.Security. Remember that the 'S' in IOT stands for security. Joking aside. I have not seen an option for encryption (HTTPS) of the HTTP-traffic for tasmota. (May the internet correct me if I am wrong) So choosing HTTP means your user/password (which are not a requirement but should totally be used) are transfered via URL query parameters as plain text. MQTT has built-in mechanisms for encrypting the traffic. I haven't been able to get that working in my network but I'm trying.Flexibility/Reliability. With MQTT/Tasmota you have the ability to implement automations that do not rely on your home automation hub by having your devices publish MQTT-messages directly to each other for interaction. For example if you would like to implement an emergency off button that turns multiple devices off you do not want that to rely on your home automation server. Doing this with HTTP 'could' be done too but requires all users/passwords of all the devices to reside not only in your home automation hub but also on other single devices.Networking. Adding new devices to your hub should be as easy as possible. In matters of HTTP your home automation hub has to know how to find your devices via IP-addresses or domain names since it has to resolve a URL. When using MQTT you just connect your tasmota devices to your broker and use their topic in the home automation hub. The devices do not even need to have a static IP or reachable domain name of mDNS name of any sort. That's in an essence what makes pub/sub for IOT so interesting in the first place.Existing support. Before building your own home automation solution be sure to check out home assistant (my favorite) or any of the other home automation solutions if they fit your need. Do not reinvent the wheel. A tipp for home assistant: Do not use MQTT auto discovery in combination with tasmota. This is the only thing that has not worked out for me. Manually registering devices works reliably.Hope that helps. If you still prefer HTTP checkout the app \"Tasmota control\"."},

{"title": "Synchronize Data From Multiple Data Sources", "description": "Our team is trying to build a predictive maintenance system whose task is to look at a set of events and predict whether these events depict a set of known anomalies or not.We are at the design phase and the current system design is as follows:In order to classify a set of events as an anomaly, the events have to occur in the same time window. e.g. say there are three data sources pushing their respective events into Kafka topics, but due to some reason, the data is not synchronized.\nSo one of the inference engines pulls the latest entries from each of the kafka topics, but the corresponding events in the pulled data do not belong to the same time window (say 1 hour). That will result in invalid predictions due to out-of-sync data.We need to figure out how can we make sure that the data from all three sources are pushed in-order so that when an inference engine requests entries (say the last 100 entries) from multiple kakfa topics, the corresponding entries in each topic belong to the same time window?I would suggest , which is a streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka.

See the bottom section for considerations for real-world applications.That aside, a general comment: implementing vision for quality control (QC) is hard to get right. If the product to be inspected is cheap (e.g. a ring, a small plastic thing), and if the result of the vision inspection is a borderline pass/fail, or uncertain, you can reject the part. If the part to be inspected is expensive (e.g. a large assembly for a tractor, individual CPUs, medical devices near the end of the production line), then you have to have very well defined specifications, and the system needs to be made as robust as possible.In general, you want to optimize imaging for each type of defect. For example, the camera location, lens, and lighting to detect scratches may be quite different than what is needed for dimensional gauging (a.k.a. dimensional measurement).\nWhen you search online for algorithms, equipment, and techniques specific to vision for industrial automation, including the quality control of parts on production lines, then for English-language websites favor the term \"machine vision\" instead of \"computer vision.\"Machine vision is the common industry term for image processing (+ cameras + lighting + ...) for industrial use. Although different people may use different terminology, and the terminology isn't as important as learning techniques, you'll find a lot of material by searching for \"machine vision.\" The term \"computer vision\" tends to be used for non-industrial applications, and for academic research, though in languages other than English the terms \"machine vision\" and \"computer vision\" may be the same. By comparison, \"medical imaging\" is similar to machine vision, but involves application of image processing to medical applications.Most importantly, you must control the lighting. Ambient lighting, such as desk lamps, overhead lights, etc., are not only useless for a vision system inspecting parts in production, but will typically interfere with image processing. You might find  defects sometimes with poorly controlled light, but to generate the most consistent results, you'll need to set up lights in specific locations, run the lights at specific, verifiable intensities, and have your vision system detect when something has gone wrong with the lighting.There are \"machine vision lights\" designed especially for specific applications such as finding scratches in shiny surfaces, making shiny surfaces look less shiny, to backlight parts (which is useful for dimensional gauging), to illuminate parts from low angles, and so on. Read about different types of lighting.Rather than spend a lot of money on special lights, you can mock them up:The importance of lighting can not be underestimated. Controlling lighting conditions improves the chance of success, and is typically necessary to achieve the accuracy of measurement or pass/fail assessment required in real-world environments.\nAt some point you'll probably wonder whether machine learning is useful or necessary for the application. The question to ask yourself (or the customer) is this: what percentage of defects would need to be detected?For example, if a chip is missing from the ring that could be a fatal defect. Is the ring used in some safety-critical application? If so, vision inspection for QC would have to be extraordinarily robust.Even if you're familiar with the terms \"accuracy\" and \"precision,\" make sure they have very clear meanings as you consider image processing problems:So, what percentage of chip defects needs to be found? 90%? 95%? 98%?Using the term \"accurate\" more loosely to mean \"the vision system gets the measurement correct and/or finds the defects we know are there,\" what is the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning algorithm you've read about? Or at least, what would qualify as reasonably impressive accuracy for machine learning? 95%? 98%?If you're making measurements of machine parts on a production line, then you would typically want the accuracy of dimensional measurements and defect detection to be 99% or better. For high-value products, and products such as electronic components that are highly sensitive to defects, accuracy may need to be 99.999% or better. Think of it this way: if a manufacturer is making thousands or tens of thousands of parts, they don't want garbage parts to make it past your vision system several times a day. Machine learning for image processing has been around a long time. Processing speeds, memory, and training set sizes have improved, and there have been improvements in algorithms as well, but it's important to note that machine learning is suitable only for some applications, and will fail miserably at other applications. Get the exact diameter, including tolerances. If the nominal diameter is 3.000 inches, then then tolerance might be expressed in terms of thousands of an inch. You may not need to know that for a student project, but if you were proposing a solution for a factory owner you wouldn't want to even suggest a price or timeline for delivery without having complete specs for the part, and numerous samples of the part.From the one image it's not possible to be too specific about what a defect might look like--the same part can have different defects in different factories, or even on different production lines of the same factory--but we can make some guesses.From the one image it's not clear what the surface coating is supposed to look like, or what's underneath. What is the surface coating? Anodization? Paint? Enamel? Plastic? Cheese? Whatever the case, knowing what material it is, and how that material degrades, will give some clues about what sort of vision setup may help detect problems with the coating. Changes in coating quality can affect apparent texture (e.g. edge content), brightness/darkness (intensity), color, shininess, and so on.For the moment, let's assume the coating peeling off changes the brightness or texture of the uncoated surface vs. the remaining coated surface. Then your image processing might look something like the following:It's hard to guess what technique would be relevant here without photos and/or a much more specific description of the coating. Hopefully this makes it clear why specs are important.Coatings can be absent in different ways: peeling, small absences (voids), partially scraped away, etc. It can be difficult to predict in advance what the shape and size of missing coating may be.When the size and shape of a defect is hard to predict, but when the defect is associated with a difference in image intensity (pixel brightness) or color, then explore these ideas:Once you have some basic algorithm that identifies the difference between good parts and parts with some missing coating, then you could consider using machine learning to review lots (lots!) of samples to help determine the best parameterization. For example, how do you know what number of edge pixels or edge pixel strength should be considered \"bad\"? It depends on whether the chip is visible just from the part's outline. For example, if you placed the part on a light table (a.k.a. \"backlight\"), would you  see a defect considered to be a \"chip\"? Or could the chip just be on the top surface facing the camera?To find chips on edges, having the part on a backlight simplifies matters greatly.A simpler approach could be to fit a black-and-white mask--a template--representing a good part to the current location and rotation of the part to be inspected. If the template and sample part are aligned very precisely, and if you perform image subtraction, then you may be fortunate enough to get clusters or pixels where there are defects. But this method is fairly crude, and harder to make robust.There are machine learning techniques to identify chips on edges, but you'd need lots of part samples to train the techniques. Optionally, if you don't have enough samples, you can use the sample samples with slightly modified lighting, at different locations in the image, with manually added defects, etc., to help train the algorithm. But that's another discussion altogether.See the link above about different types of lighting. You'll need to experiment with a few different lighting configurations to figure out what works for your part.Generally, though, scratches are likely to have difference in brightness and \"edginess\" (image edge content) relative to the rest of the part. If you're lucky, a scratch can reveal a different color.Scratches can vary so much in appearance, area, and shape that it would be hard to parameterize an algorithm to catch them all. Once again, statistical analysis of edge content, brightness, and color tends to be useful.In general: to achieve the best results for a particular QC inspection, you'll need to engineer a system specifically for the part. Your vision system may be configurable, and there can be different combinations of lights and cameras for different types of QC inspection, but for any particular defect detection you want to control the appearance of the part as much as possible. Relying on software to do all the work yields a less robust system that customers will typically yank out and throw away.This is almost an example of dimensional gauging or optical gauging. If you're just looking for unevenness, you don't necessarily need to measurement diameter in engineering units such as millimeters: you can just measure pixels. BUT the effort required to ensure your measurement in pixels is accurate will typically lead you to measuring in millimeters anyway.Assuming the optical setup  is correct and (more or less) calibrated, which I'll describe below, here's a basic process:You might call a part \"bad\" for one or more of the following conditions:Measurement of distance depends on the consistency of point-to-point distances at different locations within the image. If you perform accurate, precise measurements of distance, you'll notice that an object of fixed length appears to vary in length depending on its location in the image: if the object is located in the center of the image it may appear to be 57.5 pixels long, but in one corner of the image it may appear to be 56.2 pixels long. To correct for these irregularities, you can...Use cameras imaging from the sides. Make sure the background is simple.A 1- to 2-degree difference could be hard to detect using a camera placed directed overhead. If you're lucky you could detect that the outer edge of the part is more elliptical than circular, but the ability to detect this would depend on the color and thickness of the part. Also, you wouldn't necessarily be able to distinguish between a misshapen part and one resting at an angle--but for some inspections that's okay since both are defects. HOWEVER, in a real-world application the customer might not be happy if you reject parts that are otherwise good, but happen to be sitting at a slight angle. A mechanical fixture might fix the problem by ensure parts are lying flat.The image isn't clear enough. Put the part on a simpler background and tinker with lighting to make it more obvious what the differences are between good and bad.Run one algorithm after the other. You may also have to turn different lights on and off before running each algorithm (or rather, each chain of algorithms).You may have to write an algorithm to detect whether multiple rings happen to be present. Even if you weren't asked to do this specifically, this happens in production, and your professor may surprise you with it. At least have an idea how you would detect the presence of multiple rings.That's another aspect of vision: you may start thinking of what algorithms and lighting are necessary to solve \"the problem,\" but you'll also spend a lot of time figuring out everything that could go wrong, and writing software to detect those conditions to ensure you don't yield a false result. For example, what happens if the lights turn off? What if two rings are present? What if the ring isn't fully within the field of view? What if dirt gets on the surface the part is resting on? What if the lens gets dirty (which it will)?A few principles:\nIf it were a real-world application--that is, if you went into the field of vision professionally--there are many more steps that may seem less difficult, but that turn out to be critical:This isn't to say university isn't the real world: just that you probably won't lose tens or hundreds of thousands of Euros/pounds/dollars if you happen to overlook something.You can see how to makes face recognition.But in your case, you can skip paragraph 3 and compare 2 with the reference image. Depending on the conditions, additional filtering may be necessary.", "accepted_answer": "Since this is for a student project I'll emphasize image processing more than other aspects of an application. See the bottom section for considerations for real-world applications.That aside, a general comment: implementing vision for quality control (QC) is hard to get right. If the product to be inspected is cheap (e.g. a ring, a small plastic thing), and if the result of the vision inspection is a borderline pass/fail, or uncertain, you can reject the part. If the part to be inspected is expensive (e.g. a large assembly for a tractor, individual CPUs, medical devices near the end of the production line), then you have to have very well defined specifications, and the system needs to be made as robust as possible.In general, you want to optimize imaging for each type of defect. For example, the camera location, lens, and lighting to detect scratches may be quite different than what is needed for dimensional gauging (a.k.a. dimensional measurement).\nWhen you search online for algorithms, equipment, and techniques specific to vision for industrial automation, including the quality control of parts on production lines, then for English-language websites favor the term \"machine vision\" instead of \"computer vision.\"Machine vision is the common industry term for image processing (+ cameras + lighting + ...) for industrial use. Although different people may use different terminology, and the terminology isn't as important as learning techniques, you'll find a lot of material by searching for \"machine vision.\" The term \"computer vision\" tends to be used for non-industrial applications, and for academic research, though in languages other than English the terms \"machine vision\" and \"computer vision\" may be the same. By comparison, \"medical imaging\" is similar to machine vision, but involves application of image processing to medical applications.Most importantly, you must control the lighting. Ambient lighting, such as desk lamps, overhead lights, etc., are not only useless for a vision system inspecting parts in production, but will typically interfere with image processing. You might find  defects sometimes with poorly controlled light, but to generate the most consistent results, you'll need to set up lights in specific locations, run the lights at specific, verifiable intensities, and have your vision system detect when something has gone wrong with the lighting.There are \"machine vision lights\" designed especially for specific applications such as finding scratches in shiny surfaces, making shiny surfaces look less shiny, to backlight parts (which is useful for dimensional gauging), to illuminate parts from low angles, and so on. Read about different types of lighting.Rather than spend a lot of money on special lights, you can mock them up:The importance of lighting can not be underestimated. Controlling lighting conditions improves the chance of success, and is typically necessary to achieve the accuracy of measurement or pass/fail assessment required in real-world environments.\nAt some point you'll probably wonder whether machine learning is useful or necessary for the application. The question to ask yourself (or the customer) is this: what percentage of defects would need to be detected?For example, if a chip is missing from the ring that could be a fatal defect. Is the ring used in some safety-critical application? If so, vision inspection for QC would have to be extraordinarily robust.Even if you're familiar with the terms \"accuracy\" and \"precision,\" make sure they have very clear meanings as you consider image processing problems:So, what percentage of chip defects needs to be found? 90%? 95%? 98%?Using the term \"accurate\" more loosely to mean \"the vision system gets the measurement correct and/or finds the defects we know are there,\" what is the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning algorithm you've read about? Or at least, what would qualify as reasonably impressive accuracy for machine learning? 95%? 98%?If you're making measurements of machine parts on a production line, then you would typically want the accuracy of dimensional measurements and defect detection to be 99% or better. For high-value products, and products such as electronic components that are highly sensitive to defects, accuracy may need to be 99.999% or better. Think of it this way: if a manufacturer is making thousands or tens of thousands of parts, they don't want garbage parts to make it past your vision system several times a day. Machine learning for image processing has been around a long time. Processing speeds, memory, and training set sizes have improved, and there have been improvements in algorithms as well, but it's important to note that machine learning is suitable only for some applications, and will fail miserably at other applications. To begin with, I have attached a picture of the ring we need to do QC\n  of.Ring_for_QCGet the exact diameter, including tolerances. If the nominal diameter is 3.000 inches, then then tolerance might be expressed in terms of thousands of an inch. You may not need to know that for a student project, but if you were proposing a solution for a factory owner you wouldn't want to even suggest a price or timeline for delivery without having complete specs for the part, and numerous samples of the part.From the one image it's not possible to be too specific about what a defect might look like--the same part can have different defects in different factories, or even on different production lines of the same factory--but we can make some guesses.1.Surface coating of the ring peeled offFrom the one image it's not clear what the surface coating is supposed to look like, or what's underneath.

{"title": "Transform an IoT application from monolothic to microservices", "description": "I have a system composed of 3 sensors (Temperature, humidity, camera) attached to Arduino, 1 cloud, and 1 Mobile phone. I developed a monolithic IoT application that has different tasks needed to be executed in these three different locations (Arduino, cloud Mobile). all these sensors have common tasks which are: data detection, data transferring (executed on Arduino), data saving, data analysis and data notification (on the cloud), data visualization (on Mobile).The problem here I know that a microservice is independent and it has its database. How to transform this application that I have to a one using microservice architecture? the first idea is representing each task as a microservice.At the first, I considered each task as a component and I thought to represent each one as a microservice but they are linked. I mean that the output of the previous task is the input of the present one, So I can't make it like this because they aren't independent. Another thing for data collection microservice it should be placed on Arduino and the data should be sent to the cloud to be stored there in the database, so here we have a distant DB. For the data collection, I have the same idea as you since there are different things (sensors) so there will be diff microservices like (temperature data collection, camera data collection...).First let me clear a confusion : when we say microservices are independent then how can we design a microservice in which output of the previous task is input for the next one.First when we say microservice it means it is indepently deployable and manageable but as in any system there are dependencies microservices also depends upon each other. You can read about reactice microservice.So you can have microservices which depend on one another, but we want these dependencies to be minimum.Now lets understand benefits we want to adopt while doing microservice (this will help to answer your question):and there are various and also some overhead which a microservice architecture bring (cant go in detail here , read on these things online)", "accepted_answer": "First let me clear a confusion : when we say microservices are independent then how can we design a microservice in which output of the previous task is input for the next one.First when we say microservice it means it is indepently deployable and manageable but as in any system there are dependencies microservices also depends upon each other.

If your use case (discussed next) is to have device report its state, and have that state inspectable and updatable from the cloud, then the  is much more maintainable; simply because that is what it's designed and tested to do- you'll have to write and maintain less of your own code!Picking an approach:: If you don't have a reason no to, use the shadow. It's a managed and well tested pattern (that includes edge cases, such as the blub being offline when you request it to change) for having your devices send send/receive/synchronize state from the cloud. It's built into AWS so you can easily view/change this state in the console. It's also got built-in persistence, so you can always inspect that latest state even if you aren't constantly listening for changes on the broker.: There's a few reasons not to use the shadow. The shadow requires you to send JSON payloads, and in highly battery/network constrained situations you might want to use your own binary protocol to save bytes. Similarly it's about double the cost (although still really cheap). Finally if you readings are fast moving, write-only, telemetries that you do not need to persist and can subscribe to when you're interested, you might skip the shadow because you don't need any of its features.So in your case, I would say you want to use the shadow."},

Here are all the Log methods:So, since we used , we're checking in Debug. That's why we changed it to debug.Notice  has a first parameter,in our case \"AppDebug\". Click on the \"No Filters\" drop down menu on the top-right of the logcat. Select \"Edit Filter Configuration\", give a name to your filter, and in \"Log Tag\" put \"App Debug\". Click \"OK\". Now, you should see two lines in the logcat:So now we know that mTextView is null.I observe my code, now I notice something.I have  declared at the top of my class. But, I'm not defining it.Basically, I forgot to do this in my onCreate():So THAT'S why  is null, because I forgot to tell my app what it is. So I add that line, run my app, and now the app doesn't crash.This popup shows only when you get a fatal exception in your code which stops the execution of the app. It could be any exception ,  etc.Best way to check is through  if you are still developing the app in Android studio which is quick way to read stack trace and check the cause of the app.If your app is already live, then you can not use . So, for that you can implement  to provide you bug reports of any exception that occurs.Check your  message and see your  file. There should be something missing like defining the User permission`, etc.You can use any of these tools:adb logcatadb logcat > logs.txt (you can use editors to open and search errors.)eclipse logcat (If not visible in eclipse, Go to Windows->Show View->Others->Android->LogCat)Android Debug Monitor or Android Device Monitor(type command  or open through UI)I suggest to use , it is good. Because eclipse hangs when too many logs are there, and through adb logcat filter and all difficult.You have to check the on Your IDE Check the windows form LOGCAT If you cant see the logcat windows go to this path and open it if you are using Google-Api go to this path In below showToast() method you have to pass another parameter for context or application context by doing so you can try it.Let me share a basic Logcat analysis for when you meet a Force Close (when the app stops working).The basic tool from Android to collect/analyze logs is the logcat.  is the Android's page about logcatIf you use android Studio, you can also check this .Basically, you can MANUALLY capture logcat with the following command (or just check AndroidMonitor window in AndroidStudio):There's a lot of parameters you can add to the command which helps you to filter and display the message that you want... This is personal...  I always use the command below to get the message timestamp:You can redirect the output to a file and analyze it in a Text Editor.If you app is Crashing, you'll get something like:This part of the log shows you a lot of information:It is important to check when the issue happened... You may find several errors in a log... you must be sure that you are checking the proper messages :)This way, you know which app crashed (to be sure that you are checking the logs about your message)A NULL Pointer Exception errorYou tried to call method  from a  object. However, that object was  when you did it.Stack Trace: Stack Trace shows you the method invocation order... Sometimes, the error happens in the calling method (and not in the called method).at com.example.khan.abc.AudioFragment$1.onClick(AudioFragment.java:125)Error happened in file , inside  method at line:  (stacktrace shows the line that error happened)It was called by:Which was called by:which was called by:etc....This was just an overview... Not all logs are simple but the error gives specific problem and verbose shows up all problem ... It is just to share the idea and provide entry-level information to you... I hope I could help you someway...\nRegardsUse the  and try to find what is causing the app to crash.To see Logcat if you use  then Press \norif you use  then \n Go to the LogCat, from the drop down menu select error. This will contain all the required information to help you debug. If that doesn't help, post the LogCat as an edit to your question and somebody will help you out.If your app for some reason crashes without good stacktrace. Try debug it from first line, and go line by line until crash. Then you will have answer, which line is causing you trouble. Proably you could then wrapp it into try catch block and print error output.You can also get this error message on its own, without any stack trace or any further error message.In this case you need to make sure your Android manifest is configured correctly (including any manifest merging happening from a library and any activity that would come from a library), and pay particular attention to the first activity displayed in your application in your manifest files.People make mistakes, and so coding as well. When ever any  happened, always check with the logcat with the text in red color however u can find out the  in those red color text. Make sure if u create a new , always declare the  in the  file.If adding Permission, declare it in the  file as well. - Initially clear the Logcat and let the app crash again so you can get only crashed log detail. You have to check the Stack traceWhile, Unfortunately, MyApp has stopped. There are many reasons for it. You can check same in logs. For this, you can use the Log.e(\"TAG\",\"Message\");Try my favourite tool  to get the logs and analyze them during development.\nMake sure to mark  and  as executable when running in Linux.If you don't like it, there're a lot of alternative .Integrate a real-time crash reporting tool such as  in order to get stacktraces of unhandled exceptions which occurred on users' devices.Read  to know more about handling bugs in the field.If you don't have any kind of interesting log in your terminal (or they are not directly related to your app), maybe your problem is due to a native library. In that case, you should check for the \"tombstone\" files within your terminal. The default location for the tombstone files depends on every device, but if that's the case, you will have a log telling: For more information, check on .First, you need to check where and why your app has been crashed  With the help of , you can figure it out what went wrong.After that, you find which point your app has stopped fix that from your point.Also running this command in terminal can help find the problem:then you should go to gradlew file location in read two above log files.I'll Suggest something like this.Check if your phone has good enough space that the app can run----prior/Check the logcat when the app crashes. It will show the exact line where the app crashed.Check if you are using something on the main thread that uses a lot of memory due to ANR.Check your  message. Also, see your  for missing elements like defining the , , etc.To see Logcat if you use  then Press \norif you use  then\nNow, from the drop-down menu select error., you can use  to get the  to analyze the issue.Now open the  file and search for your application name. There should be information on why it failed, the line number, Class name, etc.If your app crashed , and  but loaded the textures like:then that's the problem. I had that happen to me. You should always use an asset manager to avoid a memory overload."},

{"title": "STMicro STMTouch Driver Usage of a 5 channel Mono electrode design for Linear Sensor Problems", "description": "I'm working with a custom board which has 8 channels consisting of three touchkey and 1 linear sensor.There are 8 channel IOs, three sampling IOs and no shield configs.  Three of the channels are for the three touchkeys.  Five of the channels are for the linear sensor.I have worked with the STM3270B Discovery board where it has three channels setup in a Half-Ended electrode design (LIN_H).  I've worked through the example provided by this board for a non interrupt implementation.I have worked with the STM3207 Eval board where it has two channels setup as two touchkeys.On my custom board the touchkeys work flawlessly.  The five channel linear sensor does not work completely.   All five pads do indeed detect a touch but as far as data position goes, it fails.  The example has all the ios in a single channel.  There isn't an example I know of which uses 5 channels split across two TSC groups.   Its mentioned in the STMTouch Driver User Manual, but I'll have to look again for a code sample.The problem is that the macro which determines the value of the sensor LINEAR_POSITION = MyLinRots[0].p_Data->Position has two results.  If either of the two pads associated with the group 1 IOs is touched the DETECT macro fires correctly but the LINEAR_POSITION value is 0x2.  Likewise if the three pads associated with the group 2 IOS is touched DETECT macro fires correctly but the LINEAR_POSITION value is 0xC.  I thought the value would vary between 0 and 255 split 5 ways for each pad.  I've looked at the raw position instead of the scaled position but it behaves similarly.Here is my layout of the channels, banks, touchkeys, linear/rotary and objects split across the header file and source file.The header:The source file setting up the definitionsAny help is appreciated.Turns out linear sensors require a single io paired with a single sampling capacitor for each component of the sensor.  The problem above was that the hw was designed with five io's in two groups with two sampling capacitors.  The sampling cap in one group had 3 ios and in the other group it had 2 ios.I changed two three channel groups, each channel group had one io and one sampling cap.  Afterwards the code worked fine. I have encountered with this situation and I tried to find the solution in software instead of hardware. This problem is not a hardware problem, because, if you try to read channels that are in the same group and also in a same bank, the delta values will be same with each other.I think, your readings are as follows in STMStudio:  and .In order to solve this problem, you should separate your BANK_3 (LinRot Bank) as follows:The header file:The source file:The config file:Note: There is a limit of number of banks in the library. In my case, the number of banks that are required in my application was grater than the limit, then I just change the value and I haven't had any problem.The answer is a little bit late. But I hope it helps.Edit: I found a tip for Bank definition in \"UM1606 - STMTouch driver user manual\" document page 122. It is explained as follows:Summary: If same group I/Os can't be in a same bank and if all channels of a sensor should be in the same bank, then all channels of a sensor should belong to different group. Let's say the sensor is a 6-Channel linear sensor, then channels can be connected as follows: 1-Ch = Group1_IO1, 2-Ch = Group2_IO1, 3-Ch = Group3_IO1, 4-Ch = Group4_IO1, 5-Ch = Group5_IO1, 6-Ch = Group6_IO1.

A such configuration\n  induces a loss of sensitivity and a higher noise level. Moreover,\n  depending on the acquisition time, it is also possible to observe a\n  position change when removing the finger from the sensor. For optimum performance of a linear or rotary sensor, all channels of\n  such a sensor must be acquired simultaneously.Therefore all channels\n  must belong to the same bank, which means the I/Os must be selected\n  from different analog I/O groups.

Right now, the XSD have, lets say for simplicity 3 elements.

This is due to customer relation issues.What is best practice to deal with this issues?If I understand you correctly then you shouldn't need to support multiple XSD's if all you are trying to do is add an additional element to the schema. Instead, if you set the 'minOccurs' value to 0 for this new element and regenerate the CS file and use this to de-serialize your objects this should allow you to de-serialize requests for when the element is present and when it is not present.

The issue I'm running into is that the BLE advertising interval seems to be pretty slow on the Chipolo. Obviously done to preserve energy and make the batter last longer. I know Bluetooth will randomly offsets the advertising signal every nth times to help prevent chip signals overlapping with other devices.

I have certain doubts about how a client not present in the same LAN as the server, can discover this server and the resources exposed by it. I understand that COAP facilitates resource discovery using CoRE link format but it seems that it primarily uses multicast which can only work within a LAN.

But how to discover the COAP server sitting at home from a remote location and then talk to it considering that COAP server will be on a private IP address. \nIs this really possible using just COAP?As you're sitting behind a NAT, that will allow neither direct discovery nor connections; CoAP will not try to magically pierce that.Popular ways out are:For the proxy and IPv6 cases, you can then still run a resource directory in your local network.

{"title": "Low-Power Video Transmission Protocol for IoT", "description": "I am currently developing an apparatus for feeding and monitoring my dog remotely. The basic idea is to make this using 2 main components:The usage of this would consist on me being able to log on my phone (with an app I create) to the second component for it to show me the live video and send a signal through it to open the food container door for a set amount of time. I have one BeagleBone Black I can use for this project, which I think I will apply on the second component. What protocol would be suitable for the communication between both components (bluetooth, zigbee, 6lowpan, etc)? The camera will probably be 640*480 or higher and there is no problem on delays (~ 15s - 20s) as long as I can watch relatively continuous live video to check my dog is eating and well. It should be as low-power consuming as possible for batteries to run a long time. Is there any way to make the first component be able to stream the video without it running an OS?I know there are some more logical solutions (extend the wifi network, buy an already on market solution, etc) but I am wishing to use this project as a learning instance for IoT as well. I have done research, but have not been able to land on any convincing conclusions. I hope you guys can help me on this or at least point me on the right direction. I (and my dog) will be very grateful.Thank you very much.The first thing you need to know is what is video? As a summary video is a byte stream containing images taken by a camera with a certain interval. Each image is named after FRAME. Thus video stream has a resolution and colour profile and this applies to all frames. For example A RGB image with 24 bits means each channel (red, green, blue) has 8 bits for color indication. As your query states the resolution 640x480, a RGB raw image contains:But don't worry. However there are compression formats (like Jpeg) and they reduce the total number of image bytes. This compression depends on conditions like light, resolution, detail, etc. This needs to be tested to calculate total byte count to calculate required bandwidth. There are TTL camera modules (). These modules can output video or still images and can be configured. These modules has ttl serial interface. This is the important part. The xbee (which is most popular) or NRF*** based wireless transmission protocols and/or modules have ttl serial interfaces. According to their datasheets they can transfer with baud rates up to 3mbits per second. Now we go back to video byte size calculation. We need a module (xbee or similar) that can support data from the camera.At a very basic level your first component can contain these components:and second componentBut your question states that on first component there is a servo motor connected this needs an MCU to be present on first component side.

My opinion you need to switch on and off camera, thus the video stream. You need to control servo motor.

In that scenario it allows the different functional units to deploy independently assuming you do API versioning.  This has a very substantial work queuing benefit in a larger organization.In a small organization their benefits are questionable and APIs should probably be extracted from systems as duplication arises or new problems could benefit from old solutions.

[2]  It is an important work for sharing and exchanging sensor observation data. Many large organizations (NOAA, NASA, NRCan, AAFC, ESA, etc.) have adopted this standard. This standard has defined a conceptual data model/ontology (O&M, ISO 19156).  Note: this is a very comprehensive standard, hence it's very BIG and can be time consuming to read. I recommend to read #2 mentioned below.OGC SensorThings API (), a IoT cloud API standard based on the OGC SWE.  This might be most relevant to you.  It is a light-weight protocol of the SWE family, and designed specifically for IoT. Some early research work has been done to use JSON-LD to annotate SensorThings.W3C Spatial Data on Web ().  It is an on-going joint work between W3C and OGC. Part of the goal is to mature SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontology. Once it's ready, the new SSN can be used to annotate SensorThings API for example.  A work worth to monitor.[1] Sheth, Amit, Cory Henson, and Satya S.

Any change I make is then directly reflected on the device.If I connect from anywhere outside my house, it some how \"knows\" that the device is not local. If I understand correctly, it then updates its own server somewhere, and eventually the device at home gets the update.How does an app do that?

I'd understand if the transmission last lets say ten milliseconds but here the difference is huge. I use the example in  Does anyone have an idea? By default, Contiki uses ContikiMAC radio duty cycling (RDC) protocol. The protocol has to deal with two conflicting requirements: allow receiver nodes to sleep almost all of the time when there are no packets to receive, but at the same time allow to deliver data as reliably as possible. The solution adopted in ContikiMAC is to place the burden on the transmitter. Given that receiver checks the radio channel 8 times per second (the default configuration on cc2538dk platform), the transmitter has to transmit for at least 125 ms duration to be sure that the receiver has waken up and seen the packet. In practice, this means that a packet is retransmitted for multiple times in row. See the  and  for more detailed description.That being said, you won't always see transmissions with the maximum duration. If its an unicast, the receiver normally sends an ACK after successful reception. The transmitter checks for this ACK, and stops transmitting if received. This way, the expected average number of transmissions required is reduced two times. And then there's also  - it allows the sender to synchronize the start of transmission with the expected wakeup time of the receiver. But for broadcasts, no ACKs are generated and the phase optimization wont work.Another possible reason for unexpectedly long transmissions is a failing CCA check. Before transmitting a packet, the radio stack first checks if the medium is free; if it's not, it will back up for some time and retry.I found the problem : the radio is not turned off properly after the transmission of a packet. At the end of the function  in the file  the radio is turned off only if it was previously off. But actually the program never goes in this condition and the radio is not turned off immediately after the transmission of a packet.The problem arises because the function  (called at the beginning of the  function) clears this flag first. Thus the function  doesn't know anymore that the radio was off before its execution and therefore the radio is kept on.To fix the problem I put a local variable inside the  which turn off the radio and clear the flag only if it is turned on inside the function itself.

Every device report GPS tracking information per 10 seconds, and we have 100k devices, thus 60*60*24*100000/10 = 864M rows of new data generated every day.Using the data collected by GPS tracking device of a particular vehicle, client can review the traces of this vehicle within a given time period (for example, last 10 days, will need 60*60*24*10/10 = 86.4K rows of data).Currently we use MySQL as storage medium, and take advantage of sharding and table partitioning(based on gpsId) of it.

Does someone have experience running Moquette on the GAE?\nOk, it seems the examples of Moquette are running using an OSGi container, which is unavailble in GAE. Looking for a script to start this server on GAE.MQTT is protocol on top of TCP. In order to run MQTT server, one needs to be able to open a listening socket.

I setup a websocket to a few of them and transferred data back and forth, similar to rest, but with live pushes.

{"title": "OPC UA protocol vs MQTT protocol", "description": "I would like to compare OPC UA vs MQTT on basis of the general characteristics of both the protocols such as Overhead (Packets), Security, Information modeling and Reliability. Where can I find some sample data for Overhead, and other characteristics,  for each protocol so that I compare them. I need your suggestions. You can suggest any tool to compare these protocols. MQTT is a broker based messaging protocol where the payload encoding and content is completely application specific. Therefore it would be useful if you want to send messages between two applications developed by you.OPC UA is an architecture (OPC Unified Architecture) where a communication protocol is only a part of the topics addressed. An OPC UA application is able to expose a full meshed network of Objects, Variables, Methods and data structures in an object oriented way. The communication today is based on a client/server model where the server exposes a set of standard services to navigate through the available object, read and write data, call methods or subscribe for data changes or events.The main goal is to provide interoperability between applications from different vendors by defining the meta meta model on how to make information available, by defining standard services for access to the information and by defining different transport protocols and data encodings for the service invocation. Protocols include an optimized OPC UA binary protocol providing end to end security but also web services or HTTPS based protocols.The OPC UA working is currently working on a second Publish Subscribe based communication model that allows a messaging between OPC UA applications. Besides a UDP based peer-to-peer protocol, this PubSub extension will also use broker based messaging protocols like AMQP and MQTT.Therefore it is difficult to compare OPC UA which is a complete set of features including protocols like MQTT and MQTT as stand-alone protocol.Other responses already include references to MQTT material.Here are some links to OPC UA material:Brochure with some high level introduction to OPC UA:\nOPC UA Specifications:\nFree evaluation and test tools:Test / demo client:\nTest / demo servers:\nDevelopment tools for different programming languages:\nI have not seen a OPC UA vs MQTT comparison yet.

Therefore it would be useful if you want to send messages between two applications developed by you.OPC UA is an architecture (OPC Unified Architecture) where a communication protocol is only a part of the topics addressed. An OPC UA application is able to expose a full meshed network of Objects, Variables, Methods and data structures in an object oriented way. The communication today is based on a client/server model where the server exposes a set of standard services to navigate through the available object, read and write data, call methods or subscribe for data changes or events.The main goal is to provide interoperability between applications from different vendors by defining the meta meta model on how to make information available, by defining standard services for access to the information and by defining different transport protocols and data encodings for the service invocation. Protocols include an optimized OPC UA binary protocol providing end to end security but also web services or HTTPS based protocols.The OPC UA working is currently working on a second Publish Subscribe based communication model that allows a messaging between OPC UA applications. Besides a UDP based peer-to-peer protocol, this PubSub extension will also use broker based messaging protocols like AMQP and MQTT.Therefore it is difficult to compare OPC UA which is a complete set of features including protocols like MQTT and MQTT as stand-alone protocol.Other responses already include references to MQTT material.Here are some links to OPC UA material:Brochure with some high level introduction to OPC UA:\nOPC UA Specifications:\nFree evaluation and test tools:Test / demo client:\nTest / demo servers:\nDevelopment tools for different programming languages:\nI have not seen a OPC UA vs MQTT comparison yet.

You can remove the cputtemp and cpuload parameters if you dont need them.In iotmain.c, line 152 update the code with the code to gather the dht22 sensor values. In jsonator.c, update the new sensor values based on your new struct. Then follow the steps provided  to compile the code and install the new deb file. Now the iot service will send data with dht22 sensor values. If the Bluemix IOT console is showing the that the device is connected and sending data then you should not need to do anything more on the Raspberry Pi. You will need to bind the IOT service to your Node-RED instance (assuming you are running Node-RED on Bluemix) to access the data.I believe the recipe you used was this one: Per the readme in the source code, the events that are emitted in this sample are:If you are trying to capture other items such as humidity you may need to create additional code/logic.

{"title": "Safely allow multiple clients to share a single resource", "description": "I am creating a program where I need to talk to multiple devices (in the order of 10-20 devices), over different physical connections (serial port, UDP). These devices only reply to requests I do to them, and each of them only process one request before allowing a new one. The application might request a value update from each of them every second.As of now, I have an interface Where SendMessage is a blocking call that returns the response received from the device. In each implementation of this interface, ex. , I have a lock in  that ensures that no new message is sent until the response to the previous reply is received and returned to caller.I was wanting to build a Web API on top of this, and that may lead to several clients wanting to request something from the same device at the same time.Is this approach robust or even sane? Would you approach it differently? Based on the above, my initial thought would be to remove the blocking calls and instead decouple the request and response chain with queues if it is possible.The flow would be similar to the belowThe rationale behind this recommendation is that blocking calls and the inherent concurrency of multiple users will lead to a lot of complex locking, will have an inherent bottleneck at the lock and may not scale well.The issue with this solution however is that it will involve a good amount of extra work and moving parts.

You define telemetry data model in Kaa UI, which translates into Avro-compatible schemas, and generates object bindings in the Kaa SDK. Instead of writing boilerplate code for data marshalling, you just invoke SDK functions like this:  where  is a structure auto-generated by Kaa based on your data model. On the other end, in your analytics system, you receive structured data that you can immediately start processing and querying - no need for the custom interpretation code, it's auto-generated for you.You can write to several destinations simultaneously: for example, save telemetry data into HDFS for warehousing, send to Spark for stream analytics, and push to your custom data processing/visualization service with REST. All of this is configurable by adding  through the Kaa administrative UI.Kaa takes care of the data delivery reliability and consistency. You can set up one or more  log appenders. It is not until all of the configured reliable appenders acknowledge a successful write that the client is instructed to remove the local data copy.Kaa server is scalable and reliable out-of-the box. There is no single point of failure in the cluster. You can add more server capacity on the fly by spinning off more nodes. They would register against Zookeeper and the cluster would automatically rebalance the load. If there is a node failure, the clients automatically migrate to the remaining nodes.Kaa is transport agnostic, so you can plug in pretty much any transport protocol implementation you like, including MQTT. The default protocol is similar to MQTT in the amount of overhead it introduces.The integration instructions specifically for CC3200 are being prepared for the upcoming 0.8.0 release ."},

Is the bootloader the best place to do this or would something else be more appropriate?The ideal way to distribute a firmware for updates is the least painful one for the user.Having said that, you want security to avoid others meddling with your hardware.\nWhether it is going to be FTP, or HTTP or even the SSL/TLS encrypted variations depends on preference.Requirement for secure authenticated firmware updates is a digital signature suite. If your system is capable of running an IP stack, it probably has the resources to squeeze in a signature verification. A commercial solution optimized for embedded systems fits into 4.5kB of ROM and runs completely from the stack (to verify the numbers, go here:  ).This does not protect your firmware from being read out, but it cannot be modified without being noticed by the target system. Basically the bootloader would verify the signature and find out whether the firmware is from the original source and untampered with.If you want to protect your firmware from being read during transmission you could replace the signature software with a TLS/SSL solution. This would increase memory usage.If I look for a solution offered by the same company, there resource usage for the TLS stack is said to be 7k in RAM (see ).

If you want a user to input something via the screen then you’ll want to provide the UI for that input in your application.  Part of the reason for this is that we don’t have a ‘shell’ like explorer that is there helping control what app is running or providing other services such as SIP / OSK as is handled on the desktop.Longer term I believe this is something that the product team is considering / looking into but I do not have any timeline on if or when it might be an option (if ever).  If I learn otherwise I will let you know.I hope that helps.\"As mentioned in , if you have the latest version, check On-Screen Keyboard from the Windows Device Portal.From  : -There is one available (I think since 14986).

{"title": "why and when i need mqtt broker for IOT/M2M application", "description": "Just asking one silly question, hope someone can answer this. I'm bit confused regarding MQTT broker. Basically, the confusion is, there are so many things being used for data storing, transfer and processing (like Flume, HDInsight, Spark etc). So, when and why I need to use one MQTT broker?If I would like to use Windows 10 IoT application with HiveMQ, from where can I get the details? how to use it? How I get benefit out of this MQTT broker? Can I not send data from my IoT application directly using Azure or HDFS? So, how MQTT broker fits into it or helping me to achieve something?I'm new to all these and tried to find some tutorials, however, I'm not getting anything proper. Please explain it in more details or give some tutorials for this?MQTT is a client-server protocol for pub-sub based transport that has a comparatively small overhead, and thus applicable to mobile and IoT applications (unlike Flume, etc.). The MQTT broker is basically a server that handles messaging to/from MQTT clients and among them. The functionality pretty much stops at the transport layer, even though various MQTT add-ons exist.If you are looking to implement a solution that would reliably transfer data from your IoT devices to the back-end system for processing, I would suggest you take a look into . It goes much further than MQTT by providing not only the transport layer, suitable for low-power IoT devices, but also a solid chunk of the application level logic (including the object bindings for your application-level data structures, temporary data persistence, etc.).Here is a link to a webinar that explains .This is an architectural choice. IoT applications are possible without MQTT but there are some advantages when using MQTT. If you are completely new to MQTT, take a look at this in-depth MQTT series: Basically the main architectural advantage is publish / subscribe designed for low-latency, high throughput (mobile) communication with minimal protocol overhead (which is important if bandwidth is at a premium). You can completely decouple consumers and producers. HDFS is the (distributed) Hadoop file system and is the foundation for Map / Reduce processing. It is not comparable to a MQTT broker. The MQTT broker could write to the HDFS, though (in case of HiveMQ with a custom plugin).Basically MQTT is a protocol while the products you are mentioning are, well, products which solve completely different problems:Flume is basically used for log aggregation at scale. You won't use MQTT for that, at least there is not too much advantage because this is typically done in backend applications.Spark and Hadoop shine at Big Data crunching. They are a framework and not a ready to use solution. They are not really comparable to MQTT. Often MQTT brokers like HiveMQ are used in conjunction with these, Spark / Hadoop for data processing and HiveMQ for communication.I hope this helps you getting started. Best would be to read about typical use cases of all these technologies, this is a bit too broad for a single SO answer.MQTT is a data transport, so the usual thing I have to compare it with is HTTP. HTTP has two important characteristics, a) It goes from one point to another, b) It is request/response, so only one end can start a data transfer. MQTT connects many end points to many end points, and either end can start a data transfer. So, if you have just one device and only one service or person that will ever access it, and only by polling, then HTTP is great. MQTT means many devices can post data to many services or people, AND the other way around. Your question assumes that your data is always going to land up in some sort of data store, but many interactions are about events and responding to them immediately, like ringing a doorbell, or lowering the landing gear. In these cases you will often want to both record the data, and have an immediate action occur, like your phone making a doorbell noise.Finally, you send data to MQTT semantically, rather than by IP address. \nThis means that your services subscribes to /mikeshouse/doorbell rather than polling 192.168.22.4, which is a huge gain once you have a number of devices.", "accepted_answer": "MQTT is a client-server protocol for pub-sub based transport that has a comparatively small overhead, and thus applicable to mobile and IoT applications (unlike Flume, etc.).

Answer is depends on many aspects:Let me cover these topics a little more:This is the easiest one. Bluetooth (depending on class, usually it's II) have a range about 10m (30ft). Wi-Fi (and Wi-Fi Direct which is almost the same) have range about 30m (100ft).

If devices are spread over larger area (like temp-sensors in each room), then Wi-Fi based protocol is better.This is also quite easy. Bluetooth is capable of connecting not more than 8 devices. One of them is master and up to 7 slave devices. Wi-Fi can handle theoretically up to 255 devices, but in practice it's less (due to interference). Usually if you have more then 20-25 devices you need another access point.If your devices are connected to a power-line (like smart wall sockets or smart light bulbs) then they easily be connected using Wi-Fi.

{"title": "Parameter naming for \"time since this happened\"", "description": "I'm working on building a simple API to consume data sent from small network-connected sensors/devices (think arduino, raspberry pi, etc). I want to log a reasonably accurate timestamp of when an event occurred on this remote device. Due to potential connectivity issues, the event might not always get sent back to the server right away. I don't want to rely on synchronizing a clock on the device if I can avoid it, so I'm going to try sending back a parameter that just contains the number of seconds since the event occurred. So, for example, an event is detected on the device, but for some reason it gets sent to the server 5 seconds later. The data would include a number \"5\" signifying that this happened 5 seconds ago based on the device's internal clock. The server then would take it's own clock-time, and subtract 5 seconds to generate the timestamp.I'd like to come up with a parameter name that describes this time span that makes sense. Some options may include:However since this is a simple numeric field, I want the name to include the unit of measure for extra clarity, such as:Has anyone come across common and/or sensible naming conventions for this kind of thing? Time since an event, and additionally, where and how to indicate units in a parameter name?

How it's possible?\nI am clear on how device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device works with IoT hub.IoT Hub exposes device to cloud messages through an event hubs endpoint. Event Hubs has a retention time expressed in days. It's a stream of data that the reading client could re-read more time because the cursor is on client side (not on server side like queues and topics).

Then you have another client that at its own pace reads from queues and store into database. In this way you have a fast path reading event hubs.This is pretty much the use case for all IoT scenarios.Step 1: High scale data ingestion via Event Hub.Step 2: Create and use a stream processing engine (Stream Analytics or HDInsight /Storm). You can run conditions (SQL like queries) to filter and store appropriate data in either cold or hot store for further analytics.Step 3: Storage for cold-path analytics can be Azure BLOB.

I've already implemented all functionality before Kafka, and now I've encountered major flaw in the design. In \"Spark Streaming\" part, consolidated stream of messages is translated into stream of events. The problem is that events for the most part are composite - consist of multiple messages, which have occurred at the same time at different sensors. I can't rely on \"time of arrival to Kafka\" as a mean to detect \"simultaneity\". So I has to somehow sort messages in Kafka before extracting them with Spark. Or, more precisely, make queries over Kafka messages. Maybe Cassandra is the right replacement for Kafka here? I have really simple data model, and only two possible types of queries to perform: query by address, and range query by timestamp. Maybe this is the right choice? Do somebody have any numbers of Cassandra's throughput?  If you want to run queries on your time series, Cassandra may be the best fit - it is very write optimized, you can build 'wide' rows for your series. It is possible to make slices on your wide rows, so you can select some time ranges with only one query.On the other hand, kafka can be considered as a raw data flow - you don't have queries, only recently produced data.

{"title": "Networking: How do wifi enabled IoT products allow remote access?", "description": "I have been looking for an answer to this problem, but I cannot find what I am looking for. I think, perhaps, it is because I lack the knowledge to ask the question in meaningful way.I have been learning a lot about remote access to devices at home. I know that ISP's change public IP addresses regularly (dynamic IP address). I know that to get around this, one could use a service like \"no-ip\", etc. Or one could get a static IP address.What I do not understand is how some of the latest home automation devices are able to be controlled remotely without use of a static IP, or a service like \"no-ip\". For example, a wifi enabled thermostat, or lighting system.If the device had a built in server, or client, then I assume that the device could connect to an outside server in a remote location. The user could then also log into that server and send commands to the device. What I don't understand is how commands sent to the device from a cell phone, for example, can reach the home device. Presumably the off site location of the server would have to know the public IP address where the devise is located, and then port-forwarding would have to be set up to allow access to the device.What am I missing here? Is it possible to create a homemade wifi enabled thermostat, webcam, or other device without using port-forwarding, no-ip, or a static IP?Well, there are several ways to bypass the inbound connection constraint of NAT protocol. Such as:Some devices \"phone home\" to a server so that there are ports open between them and the servers, and the mobile apps just contact the servers.

Such as:A virtual adapter on the device configured to a VPN server that has an inbound port open ready to transfer data. Various open source solutions such as openVPN are considered as great examples for this service over IOT boards like Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, etc. These are used as gateways often. Further, they communicate with the microcontrollers over popular IOT protocols such as MQTT, COAP, etc.Another solution is to create a port forwarding tunnel, since the router won't block the outbound connection. There are various tunneling services that are availble such as , , etc. You could also use a cloud server that has a public IP such as AWS, DigitalOcean, etc. Again as above mentioned point, they can be implemented in the gateways.

{"title": "How to enforce the order of messages passed to an IoT device over MQTT via a cloud-based system (API design issue)", "description": "Suppose I have an IoT device which I'm about to control (lets say switch on/off) and monitor (e.g. collect temperature readings). It seems MQTT could be the right fit. I could publish messages to the device to control it and the device could publish messages to a broker to report temperature readings. So far so good.The problems start to occur when I try to design the API to control the device.Lets day the device subscribes to two topics:Then I publish messages to these topics in some order. But given the fact that messaging is typically an asynchronous process there are no guarantees on the order of messages received by the device.So in case two messages are published in the following order:they  be received in the reversed order leaving the device turned on, which can have dramatic consequences, depending on the context.Of course the API could be designed in some other way, for example there could be just one topicand the payload of individual messages would carry the meaning of an individual message (on/off). So in case messages are published to this topic in a given order they are expected to be received in the exact same order on the device.But what if the order of publishes to individual topics cannot be guaranteed? Suppose the following architecture of a system for IoT devices:The components of the system are:The important part is that as in most modern distributed systems the control service is a distributed, multi instance entity capable of processing multiple control messages from the application at a time. Therefore the order of messages published by the application can end up totally mixed when delivered to the IoT device.Now given the fact that most MQTT brokers only implement QoS0 and QoS1 but no QoS2 it gets even more interesting as such control messages could potentially be delivered multiple times (assuming QoS1 - see ).My point is that separate topics for control messages is a bad idea. The same goes for a single topic. In both cases there are no message delivery order guarantees.The only solution to this particular issue that comes to my mind is message versioning so that old (out-dated) messages could simply be skipped when delivered after another message with more recent version property.Most definitely.  The example you brought up is a generic control system, being attached to some message-oriented scheme.  There are a number of patterns that can be used when referring to a message-based architecture.   by Microsoft categorizes message patterns into two primary classes:The most generic pattern of command behavior is to issue a command, then measure the state of the system to verify the command was carried out.  If you forget to verify, your system has an open loop. Such open loops are (unfortunately) common in IT systems (because it's easy to forget), and often result in bugs and other bad behaviors such as the one described above.  So, the proper way to handle a command is:Events, on the other hand, are simply fired off. As the publisher of an event, it is not my business to worry about who receives the event, in what order, etc.  Now, it should also be pointed out that the use of any decent message broker (e.g. ) generally carries strong guarantees that messages will be delivered in the order which they were originally published.  So, if you treat a command as an event, your system is guaranteed to act up sooner or later.Message versioning typically refers to a property of the message class itself, rather than a particular instance of the class.  It is often used when multiple versions of a message-based API exist and must be backwards-compatible with one another.What you are instead referring to is unique message identifiers.  are particularly handy for making sure that each message gets its own unique id.  However, I would argue that de-duplication in message-based architectures is an anti-pattern. One of the consequences of using messaging is that duplicates are possible, so you should try to design your system behaviors to be stateless and . If this is not possible, it should be considered that messaging may not be the correct communication solution for the need.Using the command-event dichotomy as an example, you could perform the following transaction:In the event that the controller doesn't receive notification after some timeout, the controller can retry the command.  Note that \"light on\" is an idempotent command, in that multiple calls to it will have the same effect.When state changes, send the new state immediately and after that periodically every x seconds. With this solution your systems gets into desired state, after some time, even when it temporarily disconnects from the network (low battery).BTW: You did not miss anything.Apart from the comment that most brokers don't support QOS2 (I suspect you mean that a number of broker as a service offerings don't support QOS2, such as Amazon's AWS IoT service) you have covered most of the major points.If message order really is that important then you will have to include some form of ordering marker in the message payload, be this a counter or timestamp.", "accepted_answer": "Most definitely.

{"title": "IOT Node Red IBM Bluemix: State Machine/Store Old Data", "description": "I have built a simple application which connects to my IoT temp sensor device and sends an email based on the temp--warm, just right, and cold.  To do this I've used the IBM IoT node for connecting to my IoT device, and then processed the data with case statements to fall into the three buckets: warm, just right, and cold.  From there I generate an email and send the temp category to my email address.However, my temp sensor is measuring and sending data every 1 second so my app is sending an email every 1 second--which is too often.  Instead I'd like to only send an email when there is a transition between the three temperature states.  Naturally, I'd like to implement this with a state machine or the case statement processing block.  This requires that I have both data points: the current temp measurement and the last recorded measurement.  What is the best way to go about storing the last recorded temp measurement and are there any tips on the node flow I should use?If we have a look at this article:We find a section called \"context\".  This allows us to maintain state data between instances of a message flow either globally or just locally to a particular node.  What that means is that a value received at an earlier time can be saved and compared against the current value.  You have to use the JavaScript language in a  node but I am hoping that isn't too complicated and there are lots of examples around.The is a  (rbe) node in the default pallet that will do this for you.It only allows messages to pass if their  field is different from the last message.A flow would look something like this:I've used a MQTT input instead of a IoTf node, but it's near enough the same.The function node set's the email body (msg.payload) and the  node will deal with the only sending once per change.One thing to note is that the  node filters on a per topic basis so all the messages same topic, but the  node uses the topic to set the email subject.As well as rbe you can use a delay node (third in the Function palette) to rate limit to e.g 5 messages a minute (programmable number and period), with a choice of whether to discard the excess messages.

{"title": "For wall powered IoT device what are the best ways to read data and send commands", "description": "I have a internet connected IoT device (let's say advanced internet connected weather sensor, which can send sensor data and perform some advanced operations like rotating, switching on, opening valves/and few other operations). The device is wall powered (electricity socket), and has  standard wired Ethernet connection (just plug in Cat5 cable)I need to be able to get status (approx 500bytes of data) of the device, AND want to be able to : Currently my device is sending a HTTP request every (2minutes) to my central server with it's status. This works perfectly for getting readings of the devices sensors. However this approach becomes more problematic when I want to send commands to the devices. Eg. if I want to send command , my central server has to wait until it is contacted by the device and in the Response for the HTTP request - I can put some command, so when the device receives the response, it will actually execute the command.However this approach has flaws: What could be the solutions for this problem?UPDATE:\nAs @mhopeng suggested, the most flexible solution seems to be turning the device into a \"server\", so that it can accept incoming connections. However, because the considerations of security, firewalls and complexity we cannot go this way. Also device needs to be simple to install: third party maintenance stuff should be able to simply plug the device into wall and ethernet, and it should work. (No need for configuring port forwarding, firewalls, etc).FYI We also use PIC microcontrollers in this device.  details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The article then goes on to describe option 2, :And finally, it details option 3, :", "accepted_answer": " details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The most basic way to solve this communication problem is called short polling—a method where the client periodically asks the server if there is new data available for it. This is the simplest solution to code, though it is not recommended if you need to notify a device in real time.The article then goes on to describe option 2, :The next option is long polling. In this case, the client performs the request and the server won’t respond until it has something to send. This enables real-time push notifications from the cloud to devices, though it requires the device to leave the connection open for as long as it needs to listen to the server. Using this technique consumes more energy and also risks the loss of the connection. Consider the case where a device remotely controls the door of a truck. If a long poll request has been made, and then the truck goes into a tunnel, the mobile connection will drop. The device will then need additional logic to kill the hung connection and open a new one.And finally, it details option 3, :A third option is to use newer protocols like CoAp or MQTT, for example, which were designed to provide low latency, small packet sizes and stable communication over weak networks. These newer protocols provide a two-way communication channel, which in turn supports push notifications. This makes them good choices for IoT projects requiring the ability to control connected devices in real time. The only downside could be the lack of firmware libraries and examples for embedded devices, which are significantly more abundant for HTTP-based connections.\n  Choosing the right protocol will depend on your application and how often you will need to communicate with a device."},

{"title": "IBM IoT Real-Time insights and raising an alert on first occurrence", "description": "When using IBM IoT Real-Time insights, we can define alerts that trigger when an event arrives that passes some rule condition.  This can trigger an action such as sending an email.  Is there a technique that will allow us to generate an alert the first time that a condition is true but will not generate an alert for subsequent events until the condition first evaluates to false?Imagine I am receiving temperature events from a pipeline sensor.  When the temperature passes 120oF, I want to receive an alert ... however it appears to me that the temperature event value will continue to be above this threshold temperature for each subsequent event which will result in the condition evaluating true many times.   If the action I want to have performed is to email me, then I believe I will receive a new email for each new event received which isn't what I am wanting.   What I really want to happen is to receive an email the first time the temperature passes a threshold and no more until the problem is corrected and it may happen again.The continuous triggering of alerts once a rule threshold is met is a limitation that is currently being addressed by the IoT Real-Time Insights team. Keep an eye on the  section for news about new features as they are released. The latest update of IoT Real-Time Insights includes updates to rule conditions. To control the number of alerts that are triggered over a time period, you can set a condition frequency requirement to for example only trigger the rule the first time a condition is met, and then not trigger for the next hour. Rules can now be triggered each time a condition is met, or when a condition is met N times in M days/hours/minutes.

{"title": "IBM IoT Foundation: When to use MQTT and when to use REST for event submission?", "description": "The IBM IoT Foundation allows devices to submit events to the IBM cloud for consumption and recording.  There appears to be two primary mechanisms to achieve the transmission of events ... MQTT and REST (HTTP POST requests).  Assuming that a project will have sensors with direct TCP connectivity to IBM cloud over the Internet, what might we consider as the potential distinctions between the two technologies?  What factors would case us to choose MQTT or REST as the technology to use?  Are there any substantial performance differences at the final mile at the IBM end that would say that one technology is preferred over another?MQTT is designed to be a fast and lightweight messaging protocol, and is as a result, faster and more efficient at this than HTTP when used to do the equivalent.  More efficient not only means less traffic data and more speed, but sometimes it can mean less electrical power as well.  MQTT is particularly good where bandwidth is a concern.MQTT does, however, need a client implementation (like Paho) which is possibly a rarer thing than an HTTP client implementation, which would be more ubiquitous and therefore more likely/easily available on any given device.

There are also a number of IOT messaging systems provided by cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that contain some of the encryption strategies that might be useful to you.In regards to best practices, I am not recommending any particular vendor, however this link may be useful to show you how such a setup may operate:  ", "accepted_answer": "Your assessment is not entirely correct. The assumption is not that the algorithm can be cracked, but that the algorithm and all input data other than the key is known to an attacker. In the case of AES, the standard is widely published, but this does not make it ineffective as it is designed so that the data cannot be easily decrypted without applying the key. AES128 and the other (higher) key sizes are considered secure enough to withstand modern day brute-force attacks.The wireless device, assuming you are using WPA/WPA2, will encrypt traffic over the air however that encryption ceases to apply once the packets have been received in the wireless access point. They will not be encrypted between the access point and their final destination. AES is a symmetrical key algorithm. There are two encryption strategies for you to consider. Encryption in transit between the source and the destination, and encryption at rest. It is unclear which of the two you are referring to, however each requires separate consideration and implementation. If you are referring to encryption in transit between servers, consider using an encrypted protocol such as HTTPS/SSL which is designed to encrypt data in transit using a variety of ciphers. AES is widely used as an appropriate cipher for encryption at rest, either at the file system level or using libraries to encode the data before storing in a database. In the case of HTTPS, it is strongly recommended that each client/server have its own private key. In the case of AES, again, each server should encrypt data at rest using it's own key.You are concerned about the possibility of packet capture and replay to control your server, however if you use a protocol similar to SSL, it will use a different key for each session to prevent pattern analysis via eavesdropping. If you are encrypting the data yourself to send, adding a simple time stamp or sequence number to the encoded data will ensure it has a vastly different encrypted output each time. For example  will result in completely different encrypted data to . AES also allows the use of what is known as an initialisation vector (IV) that, by using a random seed, will encode the same data into a completely different output each time. There are also a number of IOT messaging systems provided by cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that contain some of the encryption strategies that might be useful to you.In regards to best practices, I am not recommending any particular vendor, however this link may be useful to show you how such a setup may operate:  "},

{"title": "Combine .NET MVC website and Windows services", "description": "I am currently involved in a simple to medium complex IOT project. The main purpose of our application is gathering data from our devices and analyzing that data as well as calculating statistics.On the server side we run a MVC application. Up until now we used Hangfire to schedule the calculations. Hangfire is an amazing tool for scheduling emails and other simple stuff, for more advanced things it's too slow. The calculations can take up a lot of time and are processor-intensive (we are trying to optimize them though), so we need to call them in a background task, a simple API call won't be enough.I thought about splitting the application into multiple parts, the website, the core and a windows service.The problem is, I never tried that before and I have no idea what the best practice is to achieve that kind of thing. I searched for examples and articles, but all I found were suggestions to use Hangfire and/or Quartz.NET.Does anyone have any resources on what the best practice is to build a MVC application, a Windows service and how they could communicate (probably through a queue)? What is the best practice in such a situation?Although there may be many different possible ways to connect a site with a windows service, I'd probably chose one of the following two, based on your statements:One way of letting your site send data to your backend windows service would be to use . The service would expose an endpoint. For simplicity's sake this could be a basicHttpBinding or a netTcpBinding. The choice should be made based on your specific requirements; if the data is small then basicHttp may be \"sufficient\".The advantage of this approach is that there's relatively little overhead needed: You'll just have to setup the windows service (which you'll have to do anyway) and open a port for the WCF binding. The site acts as client, the service as server. There's nothing special with it, just because the client being a MVC site. You can take almost any WCF tutorial as a starting point.Note that instead of WCF you could use another technology like  or even  just as well. Personally, I often use WCF because I'm quite used to it, but this choice is pretty opinion based.If reliability and integrity is crucial for your project, then using a queue might be a good idea.

So basically what is the difference between these two and what are the advantage of each on other?The main motive behind Kafka is scalability. is a protocol with public specification for lightweight client / message broker communications, allowing publish/subscribe exchanges. Multiple implementations of client libraries and brokers (Mosquitto, JoramMQ...) exist and are virtually compatible. MQTT just specifies the transport, and vaguely the application part (i.e. how data is handled and possibly stored, how clients are authorized...). The spec is not clear if data consumed on a topic is only real-time or possibly persistent. The spec doesn't state anything about how the message broker implementing MQTT could/should scale.On the other hand,  is a message broker based on an internal \"commit log\": its focus is storing massive amounts of data on disk, and allowing consumption in real-time or later (as long as data is still available on disk). It's designed to be deployable as cluster of multiple nodes, with good scalability properties. Kafka uses its own network protocol.So you are comparing two different things here: a standard pub/sub protocol (with multiple implementations), and a specific message storing/distributing software, vaguley of the same family with its own protocol.I'd say that if you need to store massive amount of messages, to ensure batch processing, look more at Kafka.

The device can send events, receive commands and send command acknowledgements. I have an app which opens a Datagram socket and listens for inbound device events on, let's say, port X. When the device sends an event, my app receives and processes the message no problem. The issue I'm having is sending ACK'd commands. For scalability/performance reasons, I'm processing device ACKs as regular events. (i.e. ACKs should be sent on port X) When my apps sends a command, I need the response acknowledgement to be redirected back to my apps event listener. Right now, the device is replying back to the source ip/port of the originating packet and not on port X so my app is never receiving command acknowledgement.I guess my question here is, is there a way to overload the outgoing UDP header to use port X even though that port is already bound to a socket? Is there some trick that I could do at a lower level such as iptables to port forward? Do I need some proxy or forwarding agent to sit in front of my app that will manage packet routing? Is it possible to send commands and receive events over the same socket connection?What is the best way to solve this issue?

I imagine you will end up with 100s/1000s of tables with minimal control over how they are modelled. Cassandra doesn't deal very welll with this as it requires memory for each table, which will reduce the memory available to the key cache and row cache (if you use it).

Suppose the Pi is thing which transmits temperature once a second. Let´s suppose temperature value occupies 4 bytes and minimum TCP header is 20 bytes, so each  second the Pi will transmit something around 24 bytes (excluding negotiation connection, acks, errors, etc). This is a oversimplification of the problem to illustrate that RPi has nothing to do with the amount of data transmitted by IOT.Now, imagine the opposite. RaspberryPi is not a thing anymore, but a central node receiving temperatures report from a bunch of nodes around a building. How much data RPi would be receiving?

{"title": "Refactoring multi thread program on raspberry pi with sensors", "description": "I am doing a IoT experiment with raspberry pis and sensors aiming to monitor temperature change. Each raspberry pi is connected to multiple sensors. My goal is to have one reading per sensor per second, store the data in a buffer(real buffer or a csv file) and publish the data to a broker. The program now is doing all things in queue. It turns out some delay. I have tested and it turns out the delay comes from reading process. Is there any way to reduce reading delay? Will multi threading solve this problem? If so, what I think is to create 3 thread. Sensor thread read the data and store in a buffer. Communicator thread connect to the broker, read the data in buffer and send it to the broker. Main thread will manage sensor thread and communicator thread. If I refactor the program in this way, do I write one sensor thread for each sensor or one sensor thread for all sensors?Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.Before re-engineering your application, you should narrow down where the bottleneck is. To diagnose this, I would try logging the start and end of each read from your sensors to a string buffer you keep in memory. Do this for 30 seconds or so. Then, stop reading from the sensors and write the buffer to a log file. If the log file shows delays between the start and end of each of the sensor reads, then that's where the bottleneck is.

It was originally developed on an embedded platform but was written to be highly portable using a pseudo-HAL to wall off the 10-15% of platform specific code. So it easily ports to / runs on windows desktop as well with zero changes to the common ~85%. It's currently written to support ANT+ sensors though we would like to add (or may possibly replace ANT with) BT/LE support. That said from looking at a ton of docs and examples online it's not super clear if it's even possible without a rewrite. If it comes to that though we would probably target linux instead. Anyway, three questions -(1) Is it even possible?(2) If so what is the best approach (i.e. what API's should I be looking at, and how should I wrap them for unmanaged use)?(3) Is there a way to programatically pair the RP with our target sensors on the fly, i.e. scan for available sensors and pair by a predefined type and possibly ID (and again if so what API's should I look at)?I hate to ask such open ended questions but it's just not clear from the examples I've been looking at online since everything is pretty much UWP oriented and I'm not really familiar with any of that at all.

Would I really save a significant baterry energy using them?AFAIK in those protocols machine would \"publish\" a data to broker and my app would subscribe to it. If I would like to gather data every minute in my app I guess that I would got to have some CRON job that would subscribe to data every minute? Or how would data gathering be achieved?At small scale (not many sensors) or when the sensors have plenty of power (CPU and electrical), or communication cost is low then there's less reason to use MQTT. Conversely at large scale, or for CPU/electricity-limited sensors or when comms cost is high then MQTT or similar IoT protocol has advantages. You can implement MQTT in a very simple embedded CPU, more complex to implement HTTP.You would save battery power using e.g. MQTT over e.g. 3G because there is less protocol overhead from publishing MQTT data over a persisting TCP connection from MQTT client to broker then there is for every REST POST which usually requires establishing an SSL connection, posting the data using verbose HTTP, then deleting the SSL connection.An MQTT connection is inherently bidirectional (although your app doesn't have to use it) - so you natively get the ability to send commands to your sensors.

With REST/HTTP the data gets wrapped in a lot of HTTP protocol with much higher overhead. If you have lots of devices those overhead bytes add up to a lot more data being sent, which costs money. So at large scale using a compact protocol like MQTT and designing the data transfers carefully saves you money.With MQTT your app usually has a persistent subscription to the topics and is automatically notified of updates.

What is the communication between the sensor and the raspberry pi? Is it via I2C or just an Analog read? If the communication is done with more sophisticated communication such as Bluetooth or Wifi and has a protocol, then it may be able to query those sensor detailsNope, Typically what the Rasberry PI sees the sensor is just a raw analog signal or a digital signal of the data.

Now i have a requirement where i need to monitor heartbeat (periodic) of each device and on the basis of some missed heartbeats i want to add/remove the device from the network console.I am planning to put a kafka queue between the devices and the gateways so that the periodic data can be queued and stored some where, however my problem starts when at a gateway level i have to monitor every heartbeat and decide which device has missed beats for a given soak period. I can't maintain a large data structure to keep the mapping, DB is going to be costly for a NRT or RT system, any suggestion how the design should be made for this.My platform is Java driven, so any suggestions if some other Open Source platform can fit the bill or any design approach.Thanks.Your use-case is a typical async ingestion + processing that happens all the time in big data systems.Your choice of Kafka at the events ingestion is perfect (don't forget to look at ways of monitoring Kafka as well. Most people I know assume that Kafka is the magic pill and it will solve all their problems, only to find that the time they take their system to production, the lack of monitoring around the Kafka cluster has bitten them hard)Now on the processing part at the gateway layer, you can look at systems like Spark (streaming)/Storm/Flink.

It scales pretty well and also has an easy development cycle if you are already familiar with Scala (their Java APIs are also pretty straightforward).You would not need a DB unless you want to maintain historical data of which device you have taken out and when. The output of Spark streaming job (after every window of soak time) can essentially communicate to your network console and take the device down. One thing to note is the soak time you have for your application - if it is big, then you might have to provision for more machines with RAM and disk.

{"title": "Send AWS IoT commands from cloud to device over unreliable connections", "description": "We're considering AWS IoT for an upcoming project featuring devices with unreliable network connections. One requirement is to send commands to devices. The commands must be reliably delivered (ack'd) and the devices should also signal success/failure when the commands are completed later. It seems that just publishing commands to an MQTT topic won't ensure the message gets delivered, given that AWS don't support persistent sessions - is this right?We've been speculating about poking the command into an array of commands inside the device shadow's 'desired' state. The device could then ack receipt of the command by replicating the command in the shadow's 'reported' state, and report success/failure by setting an outcome field within the command in the 'reported' state.Given our lack of experience with AWS IoT, does this seem like a sane approach? Or can anyone see anything neater? One nasty thing about this is that the shadow accumulates completed commands, which presumably means that I will eventually need some kind of housekeeping to remove the completed commands to keep the shadow to a reasonable size.Finally, does anyone know how clever the bandwidth use is - if my server adds an element to an array of one hundred elements nested deeply inside the 'desired' state, how much data actually flows over the wire? And similarly when my device moves the element into the 'reported' state.You are right that AWS IoT doesn't support persistence session nor message retention.As for using shadow device to store the command queues, it really depends on the frequency and variety of commands you have.

Nothing unique here, each PIR (and sensor, door contacts, etc) gets 1.5 terminals on the motherboard / \"zone expander\" (the mobo only allows for 8 devices). 3 terminals shared between 2 sensors, with one common wire.PIRs : Bosch 4 pin PIRs (well, 6 if you include tamper) connection. 12V is available at each PIR. The pins are essentially 12+ 12- Data+ Data-.Goal :I have a very feature filled OpenHAB setup running (about 20+ types of devices). I would like to bring the PIRs into the fold. They kind of already are, via the RISCO API. But naturally this is not ideal. The API doesn't pick up / broadcast many of the sensor events (seams like only what is \"active\" during a 5 second cycle or something), there is often a delay of 1-5 seconds between when the events take place and when I know about them and frankly I would rather not hammer their API every 2 seconds to pool the status of my PIRs.Possibilities:a) Tap in at the panel.\nb) Tap in at each PIR.I would much rather go with b for a few reasons. Alarm box is a mess (not my setup), I have never installed an alarm so my know how of how it all works is fairly limited.So everything is pretty straight forward. Install an esp8266 at each sensor and pull the signal (via the analog pin) of the led that lights up every time there is motion.The only issue is, I am concerned that the alarm power supply will not tolerate 9 x esp8266 devices.So, questions are as follow:a) I see that my alarm essentially has a standard \"black\" power supply that I can exchange. The manual states that it is possible to install a 4A supply. I have not yet checked the amperage of the existing power supply, so it could be either 1.5A or 4.0A. Its possible I am already running the higher amp power supply as we have quite a few devices plugged into the alarm (zone extenders, 2 wireless receivers for the outside sensors, the siren, etc). b) Could someone help me to convert  (before the voltage regulator I guess...)? My knowledge of electronic conversions is pretty weak and the best I could come up with was 50-100ma @ 12v.c) Am I correct in assuming that a ESP8266 device will pull  (eg: packet send and start up)?d) Even if the power supply at the alarm is of a higher amperage I would still be concerned about the effect when (for example), power has been lost to the alarm, and everything starts up for the first time (this would only take place after the battery has died, but regardless). 9 esp8266 devices hitting the \"startup peak\" at once?Any other suggestions / advice would be appreciated.", "accepted_answer": null},

Such a volume can easily fit on a simple Warp 10 standalone, and if you later need to have a larger infrastructure you can migrate to a distributed Warp 10 based on Hadoop.In terms of requests, if your data is already resampled, fetch 5 years of monthly data for 50 sensors is only 3000 datapoints, Warp 10 can do that in far less than 1s, and doing the automatic rollups is just a matter of scheduling WarpScript code in a monthly manner, nothing fancy.Lastly, in terms of integration with the Hadoop ecosystem, Warp 10 is on top of things with integration of the WarpScript language in Pig, Spark, Flink and Storm. With the Warp10InputFormat you can fetch data from a Warp 10 platform or you can load data using any other InputFormat and then manipulate them using WarpScript.At OVH we are heavy users of @OvhMetrics which rely on Warp10/HBase, and we provide a protocol abstraction with OpenTSDB/WarpScript/PromQL/...

{"title": "Apache Flink: Multiple Window Aggregations and Late Data", "description": "We plan to use Apache Flink with a huge IOT Setup. Customers are going to send us some kind of structured sensor data (like sensor_id, sensor_type, sensor_value, timestamp). We have no control when each customer sends this data, most likely in real-time, but we have no guarantee. We store all events in RabbitMQ/Kafka. UPDATE: We can assume that events per sensor come in order.Before starting implementing a possible streaming pipeline, we are interested in solutions for the following challenges:We store all raw sensor data into Cassandra. Further, we want to aggregate the sensor data by sensor_id on multiple time windows (e.g. 15 sek, 1 min, 15 min, 1 hour, 1 day). What is the recommended way to achieve the desired output efficiently with Flink streaming?As already mentioned we have no control over  the data is sent. For example, a customer might experience network failures and therefore data might arrive late. How is the recommended way to handle this? How can we use watermarking if we can only guarantee good watermarks by sensor_id (because each customer has its own time/issues/failures)? We can add some allowed lateness (like 6 - 12 hours or so), is that managable with flinks in memory window storage? What happens after this allowed lateness? Should we store the really late data into another kafka topic and doing batch processing continuously? Lastly, some customers upload csv files with their collected sensor data. Does this guide as well to an batch approach?What happens to a stream, when some customer send us data that is far in the future, due to misconfigured sensors (as we have no control over it)?We are curious about your recommendations. Thanks.These are quite a few questions. I'll try to answer them one by one:You can construct a data flow of cascading window operators and fork off (to emit or further processing) the result after each window.It seems the problem is rather that some data might arrive \"very\" late and not at the data is only in order per key. At the moment it is not possible to use per-key watermarks. So the \"logical clock\" is the same for all events. Flink's allowed lateness defines how long state is kept around to wait for late arriving data. If data arrives late (after a watermark) but within the allowed lateness, the corresponding state is still available and an update is computed. If an event is too late (later than allowed lateness) the state was discarded and the event is discarded as well. A high allowed lateness means that more state needs to be kept around. However, this issue can in principle be solved by scaling out. The processing of late data which goes into a dedicated Kafka topic can be done with Flink as well. Also periodic files can be better continuously processed with a stream processor. A batch solution needs to take care of data spanning files (externalizing state handling), scheduling of jobs, error handling, ...With Flink's watermark mechanism an operator always forwards its highest watermark (time cannot go backwards) but computes its watermark as the minimum watermark received from all input channels. So unless, you have future data on all channels, you should be fine. The future data would be put as state and will be computed when the time has reached \"the future\". That means, you won't lose data but you might have to wait for quite some time until it is processed.From your description, I would think about implementing the aggregation as a stateful FlatMap operator on a keyed stream. Given that the data per sensor arrives in order, you can do the necessary aggregations in a FlatMap (or a chain of FlatMaps, one for each time interval). One challenge here would be that you do not know when to close an aggregate until you see an event that is later than the aggregation interval. In streams with globally valid watermarks, the time can advance (and windows be closed) even if not event for a specific key is received.Another issue would be the removal of state in case a sensor is removed. This would not be automatically detected. Maybe a special marker record could be used to trigger the state clean-up.", "accepted_answer": "These are quite a few questions.

{"title": "Analytics Engine for IoT Devices", "description": "I am working for a M2M IoT provider. There are millions of deployed IoT devices in the field. The data is aggregated by edge devices and sent to our central server. Server processes the device data and sends out the processed info to various other sub-systems.We are conceptualizing the idea of an analytics engine (AE) in parallel to existing system. The data coming from the IoT devices shall be fed into this engine to come with different types of analysis. Example: Monitor the events coming from a device over the last 24 hours and figure out the health or predict other stuff.\nWe are trying to figure out the answers to the below questions in this regard:1) Where shall we tap the incoming data from IoT devices to feed into the new system(AE)? If we tap at the existing server then we shall be introducing a strong coupling between the two systems. Any downtime at the exiting server shall dry the pipeline to AE as well. What is the general recommended strategy for such a case?2) We plan to front end AE with Kafka to ensure data availability. There shall be various micro services acting as Kafka consumers and doing their stuff. What shall be the architecture of a micro service which shall manage device state as per the events reported during the last 24 hours (i.e. need to consider both historical and live data)? There are numerous technologies out there like Spark, Hadoop, Apache storm and I am not sure which one to start with.

{"title": "Sending push notification to Android based on a trigger in Azure", "description": "We've migrating our backend to Azure, as part of an assigment, and we must develop a push notification to an Android app (that we also develop from scratch). Basically, we have a electronic sensor that collect data from the environment and send (via socket, at the moment) a call to our backend, which stores this data in a mysql database.The same backend is also responsible for receiving calls to the Android app (also via socket, at the moment). The app then shows the info on the screen (among other features).When the backend receives a specific data from the sensor (set point would be stored in the database through a user input in the app), we would like to send a push notification to the Android app. We believe this could be achieve in Azure using triggers and the push notification hub. The part we cannot figure it out is how/where to trigger this push event. First, we thought a timer trigger would be a solution. It seems to take care of the job, but not so efficient, and we do not know if it is possible (or any good) to make a query to the db in this trigger function. Then, we thought to implement a trigger when an input is being done in the database, which seems a better solution.Is this the correct approach to do it? Is it achievable? We are new to the Azure platform.According to your description, I am not sure why you find triggers in achieving your requirement. In my opinion, you could try to send a push notification to the Android app directly in your backend when the backend receives data from the sensor.

If you control the device from your phone you can install sniffers on the phone and see the incoming and outgoing requests. But the bigger problem for you is if there is some kind of security mechanism that the device and the app are implementing. The protocol can be encrypted so you wont be able to understand the network traffic or maybe some kind of key that will allow the device to get orders only from a specific app.\nSo my suggestion, if you are not experienced with this kind of work is to approach the device vendor and ask them for the API, some vendors would be happy to expose it if you would publish your code and let other customers to use it and expand their product.", "accepted_answer": "If there is no documented API you can, in theory,  to reverse engineer the API using sniffers.

{"title": "extra light data format for IoT", "description": "I'm looking at how to design a data format to send sensor data (temperature,gps,accelerometer and others) from a device with microcontroller to a backend service through GSM. I created a simple JSON HTTP API, but the payload is really heavy and I want something as light as possible to basically improve my device's battery life: save processing time on the device to create the data, reduce the amount of data submitted and the time needed to send those data, etc. I would send text messages in binary format with MQTT, but how to format the text message? \nI could for example use a CSV format or use fixed amounts of bytes for each sensor.\nI could only send sensor data that changed (like if GPS coordinates are the same, I don't send them again. for the date/time, I only send the seconds if rest hasn't moved since previous sensor data).I was expecting to find a protocol that answers all those needs. . There is this , that we could rework on but my needs are slightly different: I just want to send groups (10x / 100x) of sensor data (taken every few seconds).Would you know anything that could answer this, so that we don't reinvent the wheel?Here are a couple of thoughts:Skip the HTTP protocol. HTTP sends extra data in the header and since you know what data your device is sending it is unnecessary. Just connect to a TCP server and send your data.Representing your data in ASCII is inefficient. For example, the number  requires 10 bytes to represent but in binary it only requires 4 bytes.Without compression, your raw data is the minimum limit on the number of bytes required to successfully send your message. Typically a highly efficient protocol is as simple as a few bits or bytes to describe what kind of data is being sent followed by the data in predefined locations.What I would suggest, if you are certain that improving your efficiency outweighs the trouble, is define one or several packet formats that is known to your sender and receiver and transmit it over a TCP connection. Looking at the  might help. They are more complected than you need but will give you the general idea, which is to keep it generally pretty simple.As an example, the following json data consumes 270 bytes plus maybe 50 bytes for the HTTP header:The same data could be represented with a data stream like so:for a total of 27 bytes, including the full time every transmission.If you provide what language you are using you may get more help on the actual implementation.You could use Google's . This is based on predefined messages containing data fields being sent. The data transfer is binary with some compression. Also fields can be marked as optional, so you may need to send those which have new data since the last message.One drawback is they there is no framing.

Not supposed to be a full feature list here, just to illustrate that these solutions contains a whole lot of functionality, which you may (or may not) need when building your own IoT solution. when does it make sense to build this yourself? I would say when you have a solution where you don't really neeed all of that functionality or can easily build or setup those parts you need yourself. Building all of that functionality doesn't, generally speaking, make sense, unless you are building your own IoT platform.Another aspect is the ability to scale and offer a solution for multiple geographic locations. A web application on a cloud provider could easily be setup to both autoscale and cover multiple regions, but it is still something you would have to setup and manage yourself. It would likely also be more expensive to provide the same performance as the platform services does, they are built for millions of devices across a large number of customers, their solution will likely look different under the hood.Third is time-to-market, by going with a platform service will get you up and running with your IoT solution fairly quick as opposed to building it yourself. Figure out what requirements you want to support, how you want to scale, how many devices and so on. Then you can do a simple comparison of price and also what it would cost you to build the features you need."},

This module is designed to be utilized with any existing AllJoyn application with little, to no, modification. The framework provides many different operations to the application developer that include: announce/unannounce files to session peers, requesting file announcements from other peers, request file by file ID and by absolute path, cancel/pause file transfer, and offering files to a specified peer. There are also a series of listeners that allow the developer to be notified at the application level when various events occur; such examples include: an announcement being received by a session peer, a file transfer has completed, a session peer has offered you a file, or a file request by path has been received. The listeners allow the developer to respond accordingly to the various events. Furthermore, the user has tremendous flexibility through the ability to change the current AllJoyn sesion associated with File Transfer. This allows users to instantiate multiple instances of the File Transfer Module and specify a different AllJoyn session for each. There use to be some basic C++ and iOS FileTransfer samples in AllJoyn Core, but these have since been removed.

The purpose of this is to be sure that all messages published actually reached the broker.Right now when I publish a message, my class directly puts the message in a key-value database that is stored on disk.In another thread, a method loops a peek operation on the key-value database and looks for messages to publish. When a new message is found in the key-value database, the thread calls the M2Mqtt method Publish, it then directly ends up in the internal M2MQTT inflight queue and it returns a publish ID. It then waits for the M2Mqtt event MessagePublished before publishing any other data, once the event is called, it compares the MessagePublished ID from the event with the one it received from the Publish method. If they are equal it knows the message was successfully published.To summarize:During all operations thread 1 might enqueue a lot of messages, but thread 2 will only be able to publish messages one-by-one in order to verify that the message was successfully published before actually dequeuing/removing it from the key-value database and consider it sent. I need to publish them to the broker in the same order as they appeared from thread 1.If thread 2 simply just published all messages incoming from thread 1 via the key-value database. Thread 2 might dequeue/remove values from the key-value database despite the messages actually did not reach the broker. They might be in the RAM inflight queue, but a server reboot or service restart would empty this queue, leaving the messages completely lost because thread 2 dequeued them from the key-value database without actually verifying they reached the broker.Can you give med guidance of how this implementation should be made in best practice with M2Mqtt? Is the pattern above best practice? And what key-value database is prefered for this type of implementation? Right now I have tried using SqlCeCompact.You will run into a problem, the very moment the MQTT client is restarted, as then the numbering will also be reset. \nFrom my point of view if it is vital to you, the messages will be kept in order, then you need to use a timestamp.

There is only an unanswered old question about this, and it seems no one cares about the state of the port when creating examples. I tried every type of control flow flag, with no success.

We are storing all data into single table in Cassandra in the way of time series model.

Do we need to focus on performance metrics(cassandra/spark) or shall we keep the data in different small talble.What is the best way to do a backup strategy?From what I can tell you seem to be o.k. when it comes to schema.\nIf in the future you might get messages that are on a millisecond\nlevel you might want to partition even lower than on a day level\nthat you have now. But day is probably o.k. since sensors rarely\nsend the data in faster than seconds. I even worked on one project\nwhere we partitioned by month, and the data came in in seconds\nand it wasn't that much of a deal. So from the schema par you are\no.k.Spark jobs also seem to be covered by the schema.With cassandra It's better to simply prepare the data upfront. So your\nschema works o.k. for 1 and 2 you are fine. 3 is also fine but 4 is\nalways kind of tricky. By design if you add 10 GB to a set every day\nand you want to process all of it, it will take longer and longer every\nday. There isn't really much you can do about it if you want all the data.Usually in this situation you make some sort of etl that already makes\nlet's say sum and average information that you need for specific time units.\ni.e. if your report is for a whole day, you make new entries in cassandra\nfor that day and store the result. That way you won't have to reprocess it\nagain every single time. So your problem is not multiple smaller table but\nthe way you are designing your ETL operations.For backups I would suggest usual cassandra work flow. What you provided\nin the link works fine.

But day is probably o.k. since sensors rarely\nsend the data in faster than seconds. I even worked on one project\nwhere we partitioned by month, and the data came in in seconds\nand it wasn't that much of a deal. So from the schema par you are\no.k.Spark jobs also seem to be covered by the schema.With cassandra It's better to simply prepare the data upfront. So your\nschema works o.k. for 1 and 2 you are fine. 3 is also fine but 4 is\nalways kind of tricky. By design if you add 10 GB to a set every day\nand you want to process all of it, it will take longer and longer every\nday. There isn't really much you can do about it if you want all the data.Usually in this situation you make some sort of etl that already makes\nlet's say sum and average information that you need for specific time units.\ni.e. if your report is for a whole day, you make new entries in cassandra\nfor that day and store the result. That way you won't have to reprocess it\nagain every single time.

The following is acceptable: IoT device senses event and then about 10 seconds later it shows up on a user's dashboard or sets off an alert)Below are some questions I have:Also, not sure if it's worth mentioning, but currently, the team is just me and maybe 2 other full stack developers. We've read up on Kafka and Zookeeper but none of us have gone past rolling out a tutorial example of it.I would recommend option 3.1 since I personally know it is proven in production for many IoT use cases including one which involves over 20 Million devices. Confluent Kafka REST Proxy is open source and makes a great way to convert REST/HTTP(s) from the gateways over the internet (using firewall and load balancer friendly HTTPS protocol) into a Kafka REST Proxy in the cloud/datacenter and then into Kafka and all the back end dashboard tools that all support Kafka very well.

UPnP implements multiple profiles, the one you are interested in is named , which most home routers implement to allow client applications on the local network (e.g Skype, uTorrent, etc.) to map ports on the router's NAT.UPnP works over  to discover and announce devices implementing UPnP services over the address . Devices interested in such announcements subscribe to this multicast group and listen on port . In fact, UPnP does not itself provide a discovery mechanism, but relies on a protocol called  to discover hosts on the local network.All that's needed is an UDP socket bound to the aforementioned address and port to subscribe and publish messages on your home multicast group. You'd need to use an implementation of SSDP to discover your router, once you have discovered your router, you can send commands using UPnP wrapped around  enveloppes.

{"title": "How to interpret the data logger format of Yoctopuce sensors?", "description": "I'd like to use Yoctopuce's Virtualhub rest api to get data from the sensors data loggers. The sensor manuals mention how to get the data, but not how to interpret it. I've been trying to make sense from it, but I can't get something 100% conclusive.Underneath an example of how far I got. Maybe somebody in here sees where I'm wrong. Or maybe somebody already went through the effort.My example is the light sensor. I've cleared the datalogger's data and started logging once a minute. The value is a number measured in Lux.First we need the summary data from the data logger. This is done by calling . Which yields a json document as below:The first line is pretty obvious - the name of the sensor (lightSensor) and the symbol for its unit of measure (lx). The  seem to be holding the data. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find out what streams represent. Neither what the  number represents. Elements are being added while time passes. For the remainder I presume  stands for the start utc time stamp of the data. Duration in seconds for ; which is confirmed in a later stage. And  is indeed once a minute. The property  seem to represent a summarized min/avg/max triplet.Next, the detail can be requested by providing the name of the sensor and one of the exact utc values. For example calling  yields the json documentAt first sight this is an array of min/avg/max triplets. Which confirms the assumption  represents a duration in seconds. Because there are 10 elements, one for each minute. Which represents 600 seconds.I assume therefor each triplet time stamp is the utc value + (index * 60). This all seems to make sense. To the exception of time overlaps.The first summary element starts at utc 1497384000 and lasts 1380 seconds. Which would mean the next element should start at utc 1497385380. However, it starts at utc 1497384360. Which is an  time stamp ! There is an overlap of 1020 seconds. In fact, when the run number is incremented, there always seem to be an overlap.   I was hoping for the overlapping values to be identical. Which they aren't. They are in fact pretty different. So I can not ignore them.This all puts a doubt on how to interpret the data. Should all the triplets be considered ? Should the overlapping be overwritten by the values of the next elements ? Or the inverse ? Maybe they should be summed ?The problem is that I can't find a way to interpret the data that makes sense beyond reasonable doubt. The \"run number\" is automatically incremented when the sensor is disconnected (powered off) and reconnected, when the next measure would not fit naturally in the current stream. Typically, if the time when the sensor is reconnected appears to be earlier than the last measure in the last stream, a new stream is done to reflect this inconsistency.The question is, why do you get these timestamp mismatch... Since the tiny USB light sensor does not have a built-in clock, it get the USB timestamp during USB negotiation from the host (the PC). So if you connect the sensors to two different PC with different time settings (different time or different timezone), you might get that type of issue. Another possible cause would be if the PC clock is currently being adjusted by NTP, which could cause the sensor clock to go at a different rate from the PC. But this is not very likely given the huge difference... If you can reproduce the problem easily, and since the overlap is quite big, the best is probably to display the clock on your PC, connect the sensor, take note of the time the sensor was connected, disconnect it after 20 minutes or so, take note of the time, reconnect it and see if the problem appears again.

To summarize your statements:My advice would be to use serverless, managed services in AWS so that you can only pay for what really you use, and forget about the maintenance, or the scalability, and focus on your project.The advantage here is that you assemble your components and use them as you go, meaning that you do not need the full featured stack when you are beginning, but still have the flexibility of making changes in the future.An overview of the AWS IoT service."},

All of them are inter-connected to each other through a mesh network (adhoc wifi) and each device has it's own data. Since it's a big space, the wifi router/access point can only reach to 10% of the 100 nodes i.e. 10 nodes. These 10 nodes are considered as primary master nodes and rest as slaves. Slaves could have their own slaves also known as Secondary Masters. So the hierarchy is like any typical organization. Everyone has a master and only 10% of the master nodes have access to the internet. Goal is to collect data from all the nodes and push it to the central database that could hosted on AWS or any other cloud services. This would mean each slave has to transmit it's data to it's master and eventually to the top 10 masters who can push it to the cloud.

An example of a mesh network is Zigbee. It's spec describes three device types:Source: Zigbee devices are of three kinds:Zigbee Coordinator (ZC): The most capable device, the Coordinator forms the root of the network tree and might bridge to other networks. There is precisely one zigbee Coordinator in each network since it is the device that started the network originally (the zigbee LightLink specification also allows operation without a zigbee Coordinator, making it more usable for off-the-shelf home products). It stores information about the network, including acting as the Trust Center & repository for security keys.[32][33]Zigbee Router (ZR): As well as running an application function, a Router can act as an intermediate router, passing on data from other devices.Zigbee End Device (ZED): Contains just enough functionality to talk to the parent node (either the Coordinator or a Router); it cannot relay data from other devices. This relationship allows the node to be asleep a significant amount of the time thereby giving long battery life. A ZED requires the least amount of memory, and, therefore, can be less expensive to manufacture than a ZR or ZC.In your situation you would have several Zigbee End Devices, ten Zigbee routers and a single internet connected Zigbee Coordinator.The Wikipedia page notes this open source Zigbee implementation:\n"},

But then if I use non IOT specific cloud services then how could I send my data from MCU upto database.This seems to be a very common problem with IoT. You're going to need to use a non-IoT service to send those larger pieces of data to the cloud.

The Lambda function would call the AWS STS service to obtain temporary credentials with the needed permissions, and then send those to an MQTT topic that the IoT device is subscribed to. Once the IoT device gets the temporary credentials it could use those to upload the larger files to an S3 bucket. Another Lambda function could be triggered by the files arriving in S3, at which point it could do any processing needed and insert the data into a database or something.You could skip the disjointed request/response model of using MQTT topics to request and receive the temporary credentials, and instead hit an API Gateway endpoint that calls the Lambda function and returns the STS credentials, however that would require you to have some sort of extra API credentials configured on your IoT device, like an API key at the very least.", "accepted_answer": "This seems to be a very common problem with IoT.

{"title": "AWS IoT Python Device SDK Shadow Update Timeouts", "description": "I have been developing AWS IoT device shadow updates for our devices for some time.  We are using the AWS IoT Python device SDK located at  on an ARM distribution of Linux (made with Yocto/Bitbake) and Python 2.7.3 (which is the only version available provided by our hardware vendor for the Yocto we use for our ARM board).I downloaded the sample shadow update code from the AWS repo, modified it to suite our needs, and put it on our device build.  It works, most of the time, I would say, but has a failure rate that I am still uncomfortable with.  Note, in this code, I added the \"OfflinePublishQueueing\" setting to handle when it takes a while for the device to connect.  This was recommended by one site to prevent \"PublishQueueDisabled\" errors that we were getting.  Here's the initialization code.  I will add that I know that the certificates we are using are good, otherwise there would be no success ever.And later on, the code to update the shadow, noting that the ThingId is set elsewhere from local device config.and finally, the callback codeHere are the various errors we get, which are relatively common. I would say that the success rate of the shadow update is only around 60%.  Here's a timeout reported from AWS:Here's a timeout error from the actual shadow update callSo those are the timeouts, which are essentially all the errors.  As an additional wrinkle, we wiresharked our device's connection and publish attempts, not to see the content (since it is TLS 1.2 encrypted) but to see the connection behavior.  We noted that the behavior we see from the wireshark output is that the AWS endpoint is served by at least 8 different IP addresses.  In the timeout cases, we always see a connection happen .  In the case that we subscribe and publish to the shadow update topic, but receive a timeout, it only connects to one of the addresses.  In the subscribe or publish timeout, it tries three different addresses.It may be that all of this is on AWS and the performance at their end, but I wondered if anyone had seen this and been able to work around.  Upping the timeout values doesn't seem to help.So we've figured this out.  A.) We upgraded to the recently released 1.2.0 AWS IoT Python SDK, and B.) It seems like they fixed a bug that allowed me to use an online callback when the MQTT CONNACK is received.  So I changed my code to this:As you see, I am setting the \"onOnline\" callback in the first line of code and waiting for that status to complete.  As it was before, I was often in the process of waiting for the system to be marked as STABLE in the AWS SDK underpinnings  (from workers.py in AWS SDK)Apparently you cannot count on the MQTT system to be fully connected and ready on the other side of the connect() call, but you can if you wait for onOnline event.  This is why we previously had to make the configureOfflinePublishQueueing() call.  And why we would see this in the logs...So thankfully this is now working much better.  Incidentally, the older code was MUCH more successful (98% success rate on desktop Linux VMs, 45% success rate on small ARM board) on higher powered processors, so I think their \"offline publishing\" system was experiencing race conditions on our small ARM processor board.", "accepted_answer": "So we've figured this out.

{"title": "Insert data with timestamps from the past to time series DB", "description": "Let consider Influxdb as an example of TSDB. In outline looks like Influxdb stores data in sorted by time append-only files. But also it claims that it's possible to insert data with random timestamps, not just append. And for IoT world it's a quite usual scenario to occasionally find some data from the past (for example some devices were offline for some time and then get online again) and put this data to the time series db to plot some charts. How influxdb can deal with such scenarios? Will it rewrite the append-only files completely? This is how I understand it. InfluxDB creates a logical database () for each block of time for which it has data. By default, the  is 1 week. Therefore, if you insert measurements with timestamps from e.g. 4 weeks ago, they will not affect shards from subsequent weeks.Within each shard, incoming writes are first appended to a WAL () and also cached in memory. When the WAL and cache are sufficiently full, they are snapshotted to disk, converting them to level 0 TSM (time structured merge tree) files. These files are read-only and measurements are ordered firstly by series and then by time.As TSM files grow, they are compacted together, increasing their level. Multiple level 0 snapshots are compacted to produce level 1 files. Less often, multiple level 1 files are compacted to produce level 2 files, and so on up to a maximum level 4. Compaction ensures that TSM files are optimised to (ideally) contain a minimum set of series, and to minimally overlap with other TSM files. This means that fewer TSM files need to be searched for any particular series/time lookup.So knowing this, how would InfluxDB suffer under a workload of writes with random timestamps? If the timestamps are sparsely distributed and our shard group duration is short, i.e. most writes hit different shards, then we will end up with many shards. This means many almost-empty data files which is inefficient (this very issue is addressed in their ). On the other hand, if the random timestamps are concentrated in one or two shards, their lower-level TSM files will likely significantly overlap in time, meaning all of them need to be searched even for queries over narrow time ranges.

{"title": "Using NATS Streaming Server as the primary data store for IoT position data?", "description": "I have a Mosquitto broker which receives positioning information from remote devices.I need to store this data somewhere to be processed by other micro-services.At present, there is a Node.js process which subscribes to the broker, and writes to the Postgres database in batches.But the problem I see is that now any other service which needs to process this position data, needs to query the Postgres database.Constraint: This is for on-premise deployments so ideally we want to maintain as little as possible. One VM with a database, and perhaps a link to a customer-maintained database.An alternative to the database as the source of truth for the sensor data is a Kafka-like event log / event-sourcing approach. Then there would be one subscriber to the broker, and all microservices could read from it, and pick up where they left off if they go down.Because it is on-premise I want something more lightweight than Kafka, and have found NATS Streaming Server.Now, the NATS event log can be persisted by configuring it with a data store. It currently supports a simple file store and a SQL store.Now if I used the SQL store, it seems like a waste of time to store raw messages to database, read from database, then store them again, plus bad for performance.

Don't be so restrictive.  Hand out topics like houses hand out candy on Halloween.  :)i.e.A state machine can be almost anything.  i.e. Hashtable, database, etc..  If you want to keep historical data then I would go with a database. i.e. , , , etc.   I use the “sqlite-jdbc” driver from . The JDBC driver works extremely well and he keeps the code in sync with the SQLite code base.A basic database would have 2 tables: Temperature and Humidity.  Have the client subscribe to both topics and when a message arrives, update the appropriate table with the incoming value and the current date and time.  If you want, you could create a 3rd table (i.e. 'Recent') and it would only ever have 2 rows (one for the current temperature and one for the current humidity) in the table that are constantly replaced.No, messages are not fetched from a broker, they pushed by the broker.

{"title": "What prevents LoRaWAN nodes accepting the same JOIN ACCEPT message in OTAA", "description": "I surely must have missed something from my reading of the LoRaWAN specifications, because this seems too bad to be true. Please tell me I'm delirious :) The following seems to happen in my testbed when I have many OTAA nodes and I can't figure out what would prevent it:From here on, we have several nodes that all think they joined successfully and all think they are unique but have the same DevAddr. Needless to say, the system gets severely messed up.Reading the LoRaWAN specification, the JOIN REQUEST has a node unique DevEUI, a network unique AppEUI, and a random DevNonce (to prevent replay attacks). The MIC is calculated from these and the secret network unique AppKey stored in the node.The JOIN ACCEPT has, as far as I can see, no data in it which is derived from the JOIN REQUEST, and therefore it can't be directed to a specific node in the case that many nodes are currently listening to an ACCEPT.It has: AppNonce NetID DevAddr DLSettings RxDelay CFList, and is encrypted with the AppKey which is network unique and not node unique. The MIC only involves these values and so doesn't help either.I would have expected that the JOIN ACCEPT at the minimum includes the DevEUI requesting the join as a part of the MIC, and also that it would include the DevNonce. It seems it includes neither.What gives? Is OTAA broken or not? :)The MIC will be different for each device because it's base on the secret (and supposedly unique) master key (AppKey) shared between the device and the network.The first thing a device do is checking the MIC, if it's not what's expected it will drop the message.So what you said below is not exactly right :Of course if you set the same AppKey on every of your device, you will\nget what you described :)Apart from the different AppKey as mentioned in Pierre's answer (strongly recommended), the node also includes a DevNonce in its Join Request. This DevNonce is used to derive the NwkSKey and AppSKey session keys from the Join Accept response.In LoRaWAN 1.0.x, this DevNonce should be random. So even when using the same AppKey for all devices, chances should be low that they would also have generated the same DevNonce. So even if the MIC somehow validated, then the derived keys will not match the keys known to the server, basically rendering the device useless without it knowing it.In LoRaWAN 1.1 I  that the DevNonce is an increasing number, but in 1.1 OTAA has changed so I don't know how that affects the results.See .The question also states:As for switching on simultaneously, :Still then, such small variation probably won't avoid nodes hearing each others Join Accept messages in this scenario, as the downlink receive window will need to be slightly lenient too.One qualifier is the timing requirements for Join Request (JR) and Join Accept (JA).

The granularity is samples where sample rate can be anything between 1 to 100 Hz. Currently I use one hour of data per document, then there's a 3 dimensional array, first level is minutes, second level is seconds, and third level is samples (double data type). This is inspired by MongoDB for Time Series Data presentations (, ).e.g.In this way, to get subset of data using  can be done only at the minute level, for example if I want to get data from 00:00:00 to 00:00:01, I need to get the whole minute of 00:00 (containing 60 seconds) from MongoDB, then get the second(s) I need in application. Also if I want to get data from 00:00:59 to 00:01:01 then I'll need to get two whole minutes, then in application subset each of them then merge them back. There is a bit of IO waste in this, also some complexity in the app. BTW I have no need to retrieve individual samples, the smallest unit of retrieval (and storage) is a second.I'm considering a slightly different approach where the hour document is divided directly into array of seconds (as there are 3600 seconds in an hours) and then array of samples. This means to get a data of 5 seconds I will retrieve exactly 5 second of arrays (even if in two different documents, if the time range crosses the hour). There will still be application logic of merging two parts of seconds in different documents, but simpler than the hour/minute/second hierarchy.However, I'm also worried that the alternative approach has weaknesses that I'm not aware of.

I'm running on a PIC chip so I'm pretty seriously constrained on memory so it really will have to be simple.I've been looking at COAP and it's got some things I really like: the UDP packets are small and simple so it will be easy to implement and cheap in terms of data usage but it feels the wrong way round for what I'm after.As far as I can see it works by having a server poll all devices it's interested in to collect their readings as required. In my case though the communication is event based, I'll probably be transmitting one reading a week normally but then might be transmitting loads of readings quickly if something happens at the device end. There do seem to be extensions to COAP for allowing notifications but they rely on keeping a socket open to the device and waiting for responses.I'm thinking about a similar protocol based on small, simple UDP packets where the device just posts data to a web service and gets a response to say it's been acknowledged, with possibly a mechanism for sending data the other way when the client object connects. Does anybody know of anything like that out there already, before I start reinventing the wheel?Thanks,Ben.Will CoAP Observe work for you?It is not a part of CoAP RFC but the COAP RFC mentions it and most of mature implementations has the \"Observe\" RFC implemented as well.You may combine it with the regular way of requesting.Also, in one project I've introduced a concept of \"session\".\nIt is suitable when you may schedule the sessions or periodic connections is suitable for you, or there is some event which can lead to a session initiation.Device makes  and CoAP server starts a session and fetches data with s or putting something with s.

For Password you need to use the Token, as well provided at the end of device registration process. The Port, by default is 8883 as the connection is secure and done over TLS. If you want to connect insecurely (and we don't recommend) you can change the settings from IoT Platform dashboard, Security > Connection security.

I have gone through github project  which is using Google Service Account to publish data to PubSub. To do so, it generates and imports a credential.json file into the project and somehow generates credentials from it.So my question stands is, without user consent, can we use Google Service Accounts to authenticate with Google Cloud Storage? If yes, how can we generate access token from it ? If no, is there any other method to authenticate with GCS?The simplest and most secure way to authenticate your IoT devices with Google Cloud is using  to publish data over MQTT or HTTP into Cloud Pub/Sub.

To test if everything was OK from the server side, I've created a small html form and if I send it I get the necessary echos displayed in my browser.I'm printing the value which client.available() returns and I'm always getting a false, although client.connected() returns true.

{"title": "OPC UA information model", "description": "Lets say I have multiple distributed complex machines. Each machine contains of multiple cpmplex devices. Each device has its own OPC UA server to monitore the device components. With an OPC UA client I want to read all the data items of the OPC UA servers. Now I don't know how to build the information model. I design a global information model which contains all machines, their devices and the internal components of the devices. From the global point of view, that makes sense. But do I have to create also a local information model for each server? Or does the local OPC UA server use the global information model, but the server implements only for that server relevant objects (based on the global information model)?Here is an example setup: In the example you can see three layers - machine layer, building layer and factory layer. Here is my understanding how to model such setups. There is one overall OPC UA information model, which describes all types etc. Each OPC UA server knows that information model and all contained type descriptions. Now, depending on the real world setup, I can create an object model. An OPC UA server at the machine layer contains all objects from the underlying system, in this example the devices. With an OPC UA Client at the building layer, I can connect to the OPC UA server from the machines and I can read all data items from the devices inside the machines. An OPC UA client at the factory layer can connect to the OPC UA servers from the buildings. The OPC UA server at the building level can provide more objects:And an OPC UA client from outside the factory can see the whole picture of the object model: But how can I route through the servers to get the device data from outside the factory? Do I have to create the object model from the machine layer again in the building layer? And again in the next higher level layer and so on? Or does any OPC UA server at each layer know the whole object model like the information model? The OPC UA servers include two main categories of information: types and instances.When we are talking about information models, we typically talk about different type definitions. For example generic models for all devices (OPC UA for Device (DI)) or specific models for certain device types (OPC UA for Analyzer Devices (ADI), etc). The types define common structures for objects: when you encounter an object of type \"spectrometer\", for example, you know what kind of structure to expect from it. The types are often fixed and when they are standardised, they should not change. If you define your own types, which can be specialisations of the standard types, you have of course a bit more flexibility.Now, if you wish to model a complete production site, you would be creating the outline and arrangement of actual instances: \"Spectrometer 1\" inside the \"Laboratory\" and \"Vessel 13\" inside the \"ProductionHall B\", for example. This model is typically more dynamic and up to change, when the layout of the facility is changed. Due to the above reasons, we don't typically model the instances in the standard models or talk about them that much as information models. You could think that they are more or less the configuration of the system.Now, as you've realised, the whole system may consist of various OPC UA servers in practice. The capabilities of each server are varying and your options may be limited. In an ideal world, all servers would be serving data modelled via proper information models. That is, the instances would follow the structures of standard types or enabling you to model them with your own types. On the other hand, most of the currently existing OPC UA servers are just providing \"unmodeled\" data. This was the only option in OPC Classic and most actual OPC UA servers are still on the same level. Hopefully, in future we will see more OPC UA servers providing the option to adopt information models in them as well. Or we might see a rise of \"Aggerating OPC UA Servers\", which enable you to remodel the data according to standard or custom models.Anyway, when you create models of your systems, I advice you to concentrate on the type information and then just apply this to the actual layout model of your system by using these types.To actually answer your question, I think it is enough if you just create the model you need in your system, since you cannot probably spread it very well to the actual OPC UA servers at the moment.

There's a column for sensor id number, one for sensor reading and one for the timestamp. This column is of SQL type Timestamp. There's a big amount of data in the table, a few million rows.When I query for all rows before a certain timestamp with a certain sensor id number, sometimes it can take a very long time. If the timestamp is far in the past, the query is pretty fast but, if it's a recent timestamp, it can take up to 2 or 3 seconds.It appears as if the SQL engine is iterating over the table until it finds the first timestamp that's larger than the queried timestamp. Or maybe the larger amount of queried data slows it down, I don't know.In any case, I'm looking for design suggestions here, specifically to address to points: why is it so slow? and how can I make it faster?Is there any design technique that could be applied here? I don't know much about SQL, maybe there's a way to let the SQL engine know the data is ordered (right now it's not but I could order it upon insertion I guess) and speed up the query.

{"title": "Wink API Subscriptions Stop Sending Overnight", "description": "I'm using the Wink API to control lights and thermostats etc. In the API you can subscribe to device topics to receive events such as when a light is turned on or off. This is handled through PubNub. I have this all working except that the events stop being sent if I leave the system overnight. If I try to \"manually\" toggle a light by tapping the physical switch then normally an event is fired and received by my application via PubNub. Restarting my application and thus reconnecting to PubNub does NOT resolve the issue. The only way I've found to resolve the issue is to open the Wink app itself. Nothing else needs to be done but to open the Wink app. Then if I manually toggle the switch the event will show up and be received by my application. This solution works even if I don't restart my application. There appears to be some sort of wake or keep-alive going on. Although I don't see anything in the Wink API docs that state such. There is also nothing sent from PubNub during this downtime. I have logging being sent out for the status(), message(), and presence() callbacks and nothing is logged from these overnight. Therefore taking all the above into account I believe the issue resides on the Wink side of things.Unfortunately, Wink does not provide developer support. The Wink app is obviously doing something but because the transactions are encrypted it is unknown what it is doing. Also my test cycle is 8 hours long currently so it is difficult to debug this by trial and error. I'm working to see if this \"timeout\" is shorter than the overnight 8 hours I've experienced so far. i've also tried power cycling my Wink Hub yesterday but that did not resolve the issue.Anyone else run into this issue?

On the other hand, each actor can be tasked to handle fairly complex business logic using Akka's functionality-rich API.  This results in great flexibility in determining how much workload an actor should bear.In general,  and  are the two key factors in the design of the device actor.  If total device quantity is large, one should consider having some group-device actors each of which handles a set of devices using, for instance, a private key-value collection.  On the other hand, if each IoT device involves fairly complex computation or state mutation logic, it might be better to make each actor represent an individual device.  It's worth noting that the two strategies aren't mutually exclusive.For historical data, I would recommend having actors periodically fed to a database (e.g. Cassandra, PostgreSQL) for OLAP queries.  Actors should be left to answer only simple queries.Akka actors have a well-defined  with hooks like , ,  for programmatic logic control.   can be created to manage actors in accordance with specific business rules (send alerts, restart actors, etc).On customizing attributes (e.g. unit of measure) specific to the type of devices, one could model a device type along with its associated sensor attributes, say, as a  and make it a parameter of the device actor.Capability of handling different message types via non-blocking message passing is one of the biggest strengths of Akka actors. The  partial function in an actor effectively handles various message types via pattern matching.

To program the device I use contiki. \nMy idea was to let it send messages in fixed intervals with the return of as content. A second device reads that message and stores it in a file, together with its own clock_time (void) return value. With that I could say:At temperature A, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 600 clock ticks to receive 100 messages.At temperature B, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 800 clock ticks to receive 100 messages. This would mean that the device truly is slower at temperature B, because the receiver had to wait longer. I am stuck right now, because I get different results every time I perform my solution + the results get distorted at the moment the link quality is not perfect and some packages are getting lost.\nIs there a solution, maybe with a different setup, that helps me to prove the idea?If you want to measure deviations in the frequency of a clock, use a . This is what it's made for, and it can measure frequencies to a much higher degree of precision than your microcontroller could ever achieve.Generally speaking, most clock sources should be stable enough over a device's operating temperature range that differences in runtime should be negligible. If you're running your device at extreme enough temperatures that clock speeds are drifting by even a few percent, this is likely to prevent radios from operating, as their transmit/receive frequency will drift as well.You can send the messages with constant interval between them (e.g. every 5 milliseconds in A's time), and add a sequence number to the each messages. This way, you will know the expected time of each received message relative to the previous messages, even if some messages are missing.To measure the CPU speed, you don't really need to measure the time to receive and process each message. It will not be an objective measure anyway because a lot of the time in communication is actually spent on the actual reception, which is clocked from the radio clock, not from the one driving CPU. And if the CPU speed is really what you want to measure, don't use . You need to configure an msp430 hardware timer to be sourced from the DCO.Another option, if carrying out with your idea seems too complex, is to compare the DCO frequency with the frequency of the Low-Frequency crystal oscillator. This will not give the most accurate results, since the crystal is also affected by temperature, but is good enough if you want to measure the CPU speed to the accuracy of %, not ppm. See the function   to do it.The MSP430 typically has a free running internal oscillator that you program to give an approximate operating frequency for the processor clock.  This calibration alternates between two frequencies to give an approximation to the desired operating frequency.

And I want to measure it somehow.If you want to measure deviations in the frequency of a clock, use a . This is what it's made for, and it can measure frequencies to a much higher degree of precision than your microcontroller could ever achieve.Generally speaking, most clock sources should be stable enough over a device's operating temperature range that differences in runtime should be negligible. If you're running your device at extreme enough temperatures that clock speeds are drifting by even a few percent, this is likely to prevent radios from operating, as their transmit/receive frequency will drift as well.You can send the messages with constant interval between them (e.g. every 5 milliseconds in A's time), and add a sequence number to the each messages. This way, you will know the expected time of each received message relative to the previous messages, even if some messages are missing.To measure the CPU speed, you don't really need to measure the time to receive and process each message. It will not be an objective measure anyway because a lot of the time in communication is actually spent on the actual reception, which is clocked from the radio clock, not from the one driving CPU. And if the CPU speed is really what you want to measure, don't use . You need to configure an msp430 hardware timer to be sourced from the DCO.Another option, if carrying out with your idea seems too complex, is to compare the DCO frequency with the frequency of the Low-Frequency crystal oscillator. This will not give the most accurate results, since the crystal is also affected by temperature, but is good enough if you want to measure the CPU speed to the accuracy of %, not ppm. See the function   to do it.The MSP430 typically has a free running internal oscillator that you program to give an approximate operating frequency for the processor clock.  This calibration alternates between two frequencies to give an approximation to the desired operating frequency.

Elsewhere, the modifications risk not to be considered by the system.For more information, please visit the YouTube channel of Multitech: Good luck.Make sure your MultiTech gateway is running the latest firmware, 1.6.4 as of this writing.You will have a bunch of LoRa settings, you will be able to see uplink packets and send downlink packets too.Most important configuration parameters are:\n * DevEUI (like a MAC address of the device).\n * Frequency sub-band (your gateway can only do one sub-band, your sensor needs to use the same one; more expensive gateways can do 2 or more sub-bands).\n * AppEUI (like a group of devices, the sensor will connect to it)\n * AppKey (Encryption key)If those 4 things are match then your device should be able to connect."},
{"title": "Sensors monitoring using Python on Rapsberry", "description": "I would like some help to find the best way to code a Raspberry python program.In this program, I need to monitor several values coming from various sensors connected to the raspberry, and interact with these values from a pyqt GUI. The GUI and the sensors drivers have to be completely separated.To do that, I was considering to make and use a \"Variable Manager\" object between the GUI and the sensors, as a \"buffer\" or something like that. With the use of threads and locks, the sensors would update continuously the Variable Manager (with while loops in the corresponding drivers), while the GUI would query certains values whenever I need.It would be also nice to be able to send some commands to the sensors from the gui but I don't know how to do that in this configuration.Do you think that this could work correctly ? Is there any other way more efficient / more adapted to do that ?Thank you a lot in advance !

Contiki interrupt handlers similarly never write to  directly. They simply wake up the rx handler process, which takes the packet from the radio chip and puts it in the . Since one process cannot unexpectedly interrupt another, this operation is safe: a processing wanting to send a packet cannot interrupt the process reading another packet.To summarize, the recommendations are:"},

{"title": "Authenticate IoT Appliance Using Firebase Auth", "description": "I can't figure out how to authenticate my IoT appliance to call Google Cloud App Engine APIs I've written using Firebase Auth.We currently do this with our browser app using Firebase Auth tokens.  We use the username and password to issue a token and then use that token during the life of the session to access APIs from our browser app.This doesn't translate well to our IoT appliance as there is no username/password - so we are thinking we will need to use Firebase custom tokens.  Unfortunately these tokens expire every hour - so we will need to use the Firebase Auth APIs to renew the tokens automatically - we think this is the way this works based on documentation.A constraint we have is that this appliance doesn't have any user experience but instead needs to be able to restart at any time and reestablish it's authenticity with the server by retrieving a fresh token.I'm having a hard time finding an example of how to do this - and I'm hoping someone can give me a simple example or some clear direction on how to keep a authentication token current while the appliance is on and establish a new one if it needs to restart.Thanks!Have you looked at Cloud IoT Core as an option?
