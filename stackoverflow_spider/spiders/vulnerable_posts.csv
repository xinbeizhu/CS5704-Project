Not able to add device in IBM bluemix?,"I am not able to add Raspberry Pi to IBM Bluemix. I have generated the access keys and followed all the steps. But when I click on the portal add a device, it asks for device types on creating new one I am still not able to add the device. Has the device adding process changed in new IBM Bluemix portal because none of the recipes defines it. Please provide the latest steps if someone has.Yes, there was a change in the device portal. Previously there may have been a drop down that had raspberry pi as an option.  Now if you want to add a device and don't already have a raspberry pi device type defined just click ""add device"" 
then ""create device type""  and add the info to define your device.  Note that the metadata field is optional.  Once you have gone through the steps to add ""device type"", that type will then be available to select when you add device and you can choose it as the type to add, then click next and the screen will have a place to add device ID.
I am adding a few screen shots for reference. 
Your device id would be the mac address of the Raspberry pi ( without the colons ). e.g: A mac address would be b8:27:eb:98:46:0a, and the device id would be b827eb98460a. Hope this helps.","Yes, there was a change in the device portal. Previously there may have been a drop down that had raspberry pi as an option.

Sensors monitoring using Python on Rapsberry,"I would like some help to find the best way to code a Raspberry python program.In this program, I need to monitor several values coming from various sensors connected to the raspberry, and interact with these values from a pyqt GUI. The GUI and the sensors drivers have to be completely separated.To do that, I was considering to make and use a ""Variable Manager"" object between the GUI and the sensors, as a ""buffer"" or something like that. With the use of threads and locks, the sensors would update continuously the Variable Manager (with while loops in the corresponding drivers), while the GUI would query certains values whenever I need.It would be also nice to be able to send some commands to the sensors from the gui but I don't know how to do that in this configuration.Do you think that this could work correctly ? Is there any other way more efficient / more adapted to do that ?Thank you a lot in advance ! I would do it like this:[Physical Sensors] --> [Python Sensor Monitor] --> [PubNub / similar]Then your GUI can use a PubNub consumer to get the data as it's streaming and inspect/do stuff.

Is there an autonimus realtime clock wilth month loss less than 10milliseconds?,"Looking for a realtime clock for IoT project. Need a millisecond resolution for my app protocol and its loss is critical. So I wonder if there is an  autonimus realtime clock (with a battery) that will loose less than 10ms per month and work for a year?The drift parameters you're asking for here -- 10 ms / 30 days -- imply <4 ppb accuracy. This will be a very difficult target to hit. A typical quartz timing crystal of the type used by most RTCs will drift by 50 - 100+  (50,000 - 100,000 ppb) just based on temperature fluctuations.Most of the higher-quality timing options (TCXO, OCXO, etc) will not be usable within your power budget -- a typical OCXO may require as much as 1W of (continuous) power to run its heater. About the only viable option I can think of would be a GPS timing receiver, which can synchronize a low-quality local oscillator to the GPS time, which is highly accurate.Ultimately, though, I suspect your best option will be to modify your protocol to loosen or remove these timing requirements.Sync it with the precise clock source like GPS for example. You can also use tiny atomic clock or in Europe DCF77 receiver.","The drift parameters you're asking for here -- 10 ms / 30 days -- imply <4 ppb accuracy. This will be a very difficult target to hit.

Python Paho MQTT: Unable to publish immediately in a function,"I am implementing a program that listen to a specific topic and react to it when a new message is published by my ESP8266. When a new message is received from ESP8266, my program will trigger the callback and perform a set of tasks.

Thank you for all your time in advance. I have tried to use loop(1) with a timeout of 1 second inside the callback function. The program will publish the message immediately, but it seems to stuck in the loop. Will someone be able to give me some pointers how can I execute each publish function immediately in my callback function, instead of when the whole callback completes and return to the main loop_forever()?You can't do this, you are already in the message handling loop (that's what called the on_message function) at the point you call publish. This will queue the outgoing messages to be handled by the next iteration of the loop, that's why they are sent once on_message returns.It hangs when you call the loop method because the loop is already running.You should not be making blocking (sleep) calls in the on_message callback anyway, if you need to do thing that take time, start up a second thread to do these. By doing this you free up the network loop to handle the outgoing publishes as soon as they are made.","You can't do this, you are already in the message handling loop (that's what called the on_message function) at the point you call publish.

Suitable API for using IoT devices? [closed],"I am writing an iOS app and want to be able to connect to IoT devices (get data from them). I want to be able to search an area for IoT devices I can connect to; (whether they be weather stations, seismographs, etc) (and potentially filter out devices of some sought if possible).Is there an API which offers this? (finding IoT devices in an area), if not, is there another fairly straight forward way I could do this?There is no way to simply ""search for IoT devices"". I'm afraid that you might have a misunderstanding of IoT devices are and how they exchange data. They can send data via bluetooth, wifi, etc. so not knowing what listen to is your first challenge. Second challenge is that even if you could see all of them and lets say but some super natural force you can connect to them, you'd have no idea the format of the data.

Real Time event processing,"I really want to get an architectural solution for my below scenario.I have a source of events (Say sensors in oil wells , around 50000 ), that produces events to a server.

Mosquitto vs eclipse paho client library,"I'm just looking into the details of Eclipse  and  client libraries (MQTT C++ libraries). It looks like the PAHO uses the mosquitto MQTT broker but provides its own MQTT client libraries. Also the  library provides a way to implement client libraries for Mosquitto MQTT broker.I would like to understand what's the main difference between these two client libraries.  it is discussed but that does not answer my question. Which is preferred over another and why? and why eclipse supports both? I'm facing the same issue, whether to pick  or  c++ client library for an embedded linux device. I tried first a minimal application with PAHO. It basically supports all the features I need, but the cpp-library-wrapper does not and I feel like the main project branch  is not maintained very well. 
Since there are two features which are not offered through the mainBranch cpp-lib in PAHO, I'm going to use  with  wrapper now.
So as you see my decision is related to the cpp-library only. But like you I'm still interested to get to know what are the differences between the underlying C-libraries.We have used Paho C library and Java library.  If you look at the Paho C code, the code quality is poor.  With the Java library, we experienced a problem where Linux deletes a temp file and Paho does not recover - don't know if that affects the C version.

Sawtooth may more easily manage the volatility of the network addressing. In your situation the utility of a DLT is unclear. :
Hyperledger Sawtooth uses a Merkle Radix Tree to enforce state agreement. That means that when transactions are exchanged amongst those nodes, each node will check if it has reached the same internal database state as the other nodes.
See Quorum as a Go Ethereum fork has a similar mechanism. However that trie is split to represent public ethereum network state and whatever private state is being managed on the side chain. According to Quorum's docs the endpoints must be known apriori. That may be difficult for your proposed network if the IP addresses change when the nodes gain and lose connectivity.
This will also be difficult for Sawtooth if all the addresses change. If at least one node remains consistent then the topology can be rebuilt dynamically. Sawtooth includes different protocol options including dynamic peer discovery.If I'm interpreting your use case correctly, you are suggesting that blockchain nodes would feed their independent views of data into a centralized server.

MQTT on ESP8266 with NodeMCU - problems with publishing,"I'm building a battery powered IoT device based on ESP8266 with NodeMCU.
I use mqtt to periodically perform measurements and publish results.
I know, that to allow network stack running, I should avoid tight loops and rely on callback functions. Therefore it seemed to me that the right organization of my measurement code should be:The init.lua ensures, that the node has connected to the WiFi AP (if not, it retries up to 20 times, and if no connection is established, it puts the node on sleep until the next measurement time).
After WiFi connection is done, it calls the measurement function.The interesting thing is, that the above code doesn't work. There are no errors displayed in the console, but the mqtt broker does not receive published messages.
To make it working, i had to add additional idle time, by adding timers in the callback functions.The finally working code looks like below:The above works, but I'm not sure if it is optimal. To conserve the battery power I'd like to minimize the time before the node is put on sleep after the measurement is completed and results published.Is there any better way to chain the necessary calls to m:connect, m:publish, m:close and finally node.dsleep so, that the results are correctly published in the minimal time?Perhaps this was solved by more recent firmware.  I am working through a problem that I thought might be somewhat explained by this issue, so tried to reproduce the problem as described.My simplified test code is substantially similar; it calls dsleep() from the PUBACK callback of mqtt.Client.publish():and when run, does successfully publish to my MQTT broker.I am using:","Perhaps this was solved by more recent firmware.

"Node.js for IoT monitoring, optimization and system simulation","I am currently working on a project of real time monitoring, control and optimisation of a system (SCADA), in an Internet of Things context. 
The acquisition of the data and the control of the assets will be done through REST api and notifications from an IoT platform (Cumulocity or Predix, not sure yet), itself collecting measures from the sensors and sending operations to the equipment.The server application will then control the state of the system, set alarms, and make optimised decisions (plannings  for the equipment for instance). In order to test the behaviour of the system, the response to a decision and finding a good optimisation solution, I plan to also make a simulation of the system (maybe even a simulation of the real-time measures). Finally, an HMI in Angular JS will be provided to the user for him to enter the user input data, follow the current state of the system/alarms and its history, and be notified of the decisions made.I am not sure of the computation needed, but the  will probably be quite heavy, and the  solution may be a bit heavy too.A company would usually implement such an application in C, and it could also be done in Python ( is also needed), but I was thinking of doing it with Node.js.

Increase number of topic in Kafka leads zookeeper fail,"We plan to use kafka as a message broker for IoT use case, where each device is considered as unique topic. when I simulated 10 message per second to 10 thousand topics zookeeper is getting bottle neck,all Kafka monitoring tools fails to read the throughput values and number of topics from JMX port because of that. will tuning zookeeper will solve the issues. where In IoT use case there will be millions of device polling data to millions of topics.

Sometimes, those commands must last for a specified duration (i.e. I need something to turn on, stay on for t seconds, then turn off) and this is accomplished by having the code sleep for said duration between on and off commands (this happens inside a function call -- hardware1.on(dur = t)).  I would like to be able to interrupt that sequence with another command (such as turning the hardware off before t seconds is up).  I've tried to accomplish this via multiprocessing,  but cannot get the behavior I'm looking for.This hardware (a stalk of differently colored lights) is controlled via a class, LiteStalk.  This class is made up of Lite objects (each light in the stalk), which have their own class too.  Both classes inherit multiprocessing.process.  In my main code that creates a specific LiteStalk and then listens to a message broker (MQTT-based) for commands, I evaluate the commands published to the broker (this is in the on_message callback which runs when a message is published to the broker).class Lite(multiprocessing.Process):class LiteStalk(multiprocessing.Process):The command always runs to its completion before being executing whatever other commands were published to the server, i.e. the stalk stays on for the commanded duration, and cannot be commanded to turn off (or anything else) before the duration is up.  I think this may be becuase I am not including all the functionality of my multiprocessing-able objects in a run() function, but I've messed around with that with no luck.The Paho MQTT client is single threaded (the thread you start with the  function) it can only call  for one message at a time.This means it will block in the call to  until whatever was passed to it has finished, even if that is code is creating new threads to do things.I was going to suggest replacing sleep with waiting with a timeout on a threading.Event or the equivalent and then checking when the sleep ends if it was due to the event being set or the timeout. If the event was set, stop.But it seems there are other issues than just an interrupt-able sleep.","The Paho MQTT client is single threaded (the thread you start with the  function) it can only call  for one message at a time.This means it will block in the call to  until whatever was passed to it has finished, even if that is code is creating new threads to do things.I was going to suggest replacing sleep with waiting with a timeout on a threading.Event or the equivalent and then checking when the sleep ends if it was due to the event being set or the timeout.

Android Things and Bluetooth Gatt Client (Central),"I've not done a lot of Android development and at best I'm a n00b!I'm looking at using ""Android Things"" on a RPi3 to connect to a sensor tag via BTLE. The tag is already configured and holds some data, it's running as a GATT Server and is the peripheral. I have a Advertising service UUID I can scan for and connect to then read the characteristics once a bond is in place.I would like to use the RPi running Android Things O/S to scan for the sensor tag, then connect and read the data from the sensor tag as it passes by. In a similar fashion to a mobile application.When the sensor passes by for the first time, the user will be required to authorise the connection on the sensor tag by pressing a button. This should create a bond.I can't see any examples if this scenario is possible or not. Typically, the use case is round the other way and the examples are of Android Things (RPi) running a GATT Server advertising it's services to a GATT Client.I've been having a look at the documentation here, but not sure how this would work:
The example here seems to be the opposite of what I'm looking for with the GATT server running on the Android Things end:
We did not produce a GATT client sample specific to Android Things because the existing Android samples already covered this case pretty well. You can use the standard Android BLE APIs without any changes, so have a look at the existing .Additionally, if you find it helpful, I personally built an Android  a few years back that talks specifically to the SensorTag. It was a previous version of the hardware, but the overall concepts should remain the same.","We did not produce a GATT client sample specific to Android Things because the existing Android samples already covered this case pretty well.

Is it possible to make my own network requests to a “smart” device without an API?,"What I'm asking here may not be possible at all, due to my lack of knowledge with networks.I want to start playing around with IOT objects in my house.

Any help is really appreciated!If there is no documented API you can, in theory,  to reverse engineer the API using sniffers. If you control the device from your phone you can install sniffers on the phone and see the incoming and outgoing requests. But the bigger problem for you is if there is some kind of security mechanism that the device and the app are implementing. The protocol can be encrypted so you wont be able to understand the network traffic or maybe some kind of key that will allow the device to get orders only from a specific app.
So my suggestion, if you are not experienced with this kind of work is to approach the device vendor and ask them for the API, some vendors would be happy to expose it if you would publish your code and let other customers to use it and expand their product.","If there is no documented API you can, in theory,  to reverse engineer the API using sniffers.

Networking: How do wifi enabled IoT products allow remote access?,"I have been looking for an answer to this problem, but I cannot find what I am looking for. I think, perhaps, it is because I lack the knowledge to ask the question in meaningful way.I have been learning a lot about remote access to devices at home. I know that ISP's change public IP addresses regularly (dynamic IP address). I know that to get around this, one could use a service like ""no-ip"", etc. Or one could get a static IP address.What I do not understand is how some of the latest home automation devices are able to be controlled remotely without use of a static IP, or a service like ""no-ip"". For example, a wifi enabled thermostat, or lighting system.If the device had a built in server, or client, then I assume that the device could connect to an outside server in a remote location. The user could then also log into that server and send commands to the device. What I don't understand is how commands sent to the device from a cell phone, for example, can reach the home device. Presumably the off site location of the server would have to know the public IP address where the devise is located, and then port-forwarding would have to be set up to allow access to the device.What am I missing here? Is it possible to create a homemade wifi enabled thermostat, webcam, or other device without using port-forwarding, no-ip, or a static IP?Well, there are several ways to bypass the inbound connection constraint of NAT protocol. Such as:Some devices ""phone home"" to a server so that there are ports open between them and the servers, and the mobile apps just contact the servers. This is the same way your web browser can receive web pages from a web server. If you have a NAT router, the router must open a port from the inside device to the outside server. This is maintained in a NAT table with expiration timers for UDP and session monitoring for TCP.","Well, there are several ways to bypass the inbound connection constraint of NAT protocol. Such as:A virtual adapter on the device configured to a VPN server that has an inbound port open ready to transfer data. Various open source solutions such as openVPN are considered as great examples for this service over IOT boards like Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, etc. These are used as gateways often. Further, they communicate with the microcontrollers over popular IOT protocols such as MQTT, COAP, etc.Another solution is to create a port forwarding tunnel, since the router won't block the outbound connection. There are various tunneling services that are availble such as , , etc. You could also use a cloud server that has a public IP such as AWS, DigitalOcean, etc. Again as above mentioned point, they can be implemented in the gateways.

picking a shardkey for mongodb,"I want to shard my MongoDB database. I have a high insert rate and want to distribute my documents on two shards evenly.I have considered rangebase sharding, because I have range queries; but I can not find a solution for picking a good shard key.If this is my document and I have 100,000 different machines, would the Machine_ID be a suitable shardkey? And if so, how will MongoDB distribute it on the shards, i.e. do i have to specify the shard range myself? like put Machine_ID 0-49,999 on shard A, and 50,000-100,000 on shard B?I think the  would be a suitable shard key if your queries afterwards will be per Machine, i.e. get all the temperatures for a specific machine for a certain time range. Reading more about shard keys can be found here: MongoDB has two kinds of sharding: Hashed sharding and Range sharding which you can read more about here: . Having said that, you don't need to specify the range of the shards yourself, mongo will take care of it. Especially when a time comes when you'll need to add a new shard, mongo will rearrange the chunks into the new shard.If your cluster has only two shards, then it isn't difficult to design for. However, if your data will continue to grow and you end up having a lot more shards, then the choice of shard key is more difficult.For example, if some machines have many more records than others (e.g. one machine has 3000 records i.e. 3% of the total), then that doesn't cause problems with only two shards. But if your data grows so that you need 100 shards, and one machine still has 3% of the total, then Machine_ID is no longer a good choice: because a single machine's records have to be a single chunk, and cannot be distributed across several shards.In that case, a better strategy might be to use a hash of the Timestamp - but it depends on the overall shape of your dataset.","I think the  would be a suitable shard key if your queries afterwards will be per Machine, i.e. get all the temperatures for a specific machine for a certain time range.

For wall powered IoT device what are the best ways to read data and send commands,"I have a internet connected IoT device (let's say advanced internet connected weather sensor, which can send sensor data and perform some advanced operations like rotating, switching on, opening valves/and few other operations). The device is wall powered (electricity socket), and has  standard wired Ethernet connection (just plug in Cat5 cable)I need to be able to get status (approx 500bytes of data) of the device, AND want to be able to : Currently my device is sending a HTTP request every (2minutes) to my central server with it's status. This works perfectly for getting readings of the devices sensors. However this approach becomes more problematic when I want to send commands to the devices. Eg. if I want to send command , my central server has to wait until it is contacted by the device and in the Response for the HTTP request - I can put some command, so when the device receives the response, it will actually execute the command.However this approach has flaws: What could be the solutions for this problem?UPDATE:
As @mhopeng suggested, the most flexible solution seems to be turning the device into a ""server"", so that it can accept incoming connections. However, because the considerations of security, firewalls and complexity we cannot go this way. Also device needs to be simple to install: third party maintenance stuff should be able to simply plug the device into wall and ethernet, and it should work. (No need for configuring port forwarding, firewalls, etc).FYI We also use PIC microcontrollers in this device.  details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The article then goes on to describe option 2, :And finally, it details option 3, :"," details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The most basic way to solve this communication problem is called short polling—a method where the client periodically asks the server if there is new data available for it. This is the simplest solution to code, though it is not recommended if you need to notify a device in real time.The article then goes on to describe option 2, :The next option is long polling. In this case, the client performs the request and the server won’t respond until it has something to send. This enables real-time push notifications from the cloud to devices, though it requires the device to leave the connection open for as long as it needs to listen to the server. Using this technique consumes more energy and also risks the loss of the connection. Consider the case where a device remotely controls the door of a truck. If a long poll request has been made, and then the truck goes into a tunnel, the mobile connection will drop. The device will then need additional logic to kill the hung connection and open a new one.And finally, it details option 3, :A third option is to use newer protocols like CoAp or MQTT, for example, which were designed to provide low latency, small packet sizes and stable communication over weak networks. These newer protocols provide a two-way communication channel, which in turn supports push notifications. This makes them good choices for IoT projects requiring the ability to control connected devices in real time. The only downside could be the lack of firmware libraries and examples for embedded devices, which are significantly more abundant for HTTP-based connections.
  Choosing the right protocol will depend on your application and how often you will need to communicate with a device.",1

MQTT handleMessage Function Not Invoked Despite Subscription,"I'm working on a Go application that subscribes to an MQTT topic and processes incoming messages using a handleMessage function.

I have verified that messages are indeed being published to the topic.Here are the steps I've taken to troubleshoot the issue:Verified MQTT message reception and subscription parameters.
Checked the connection status of the MQTT client and ensured there are no connection errors.

Data storage for IoT devices,"How data is stored for Internet of Things devices? Are they stored in traditional relational database format (tables, rows , columns ) or some other format? Is there some software or algorithm applied to raw sensor data to organize them ?

If it's coming directly from a sensor and your utilizing the native SDK provided, then it's likely to be coming over in a hard file format or XML.

(IoT) Why does zigbee smart device requires an extra gateway to connect to WAN?,"I am currently studying Internet of Things and found that there are bunch of devices are using zigbee and Wifi. Take Xiaomi smart wifi plug for example, it does not require an extra gateway(router) to connect to WAN. I assume it connects to my LAN via gateway first and the gateway takes it to the WAN. On contrarily, Xiaomi smart Zig-Bee plug requires Xiaomi-gateway to be connected to WAN. My question is why it can not connect to my LAN gateway as the Xiaomi smart wifi plug does. Aren't they all have soc chip on board like a normal pc does?
My reference is from Second, many smart wifi plugs support cell phone that connects to different network other than the one wifi plugs to control the wifi plugs. For example, control your home devices when you're outside. I can not get how this works. I thought devices can only talk to devices that share the same network(LAN). Thanks!Most people have a Wi-Fi gateway to the Internet in their house already (i.e., their router/access point).  A device using Wi-Fi can connect to that existing gateway.  For Zigbee, you need a router that supports Zigbee and connects to the Internet in some way.As for controlling devices from your phone.  If both the smart plug and your phone can connect to the Internet, you can have a publicly accessible server on the Internet that relays messages from the phone to the smart plug.","Most people have a Wi-Fi gateway to the Internet in their house already (i.e., their router/access point).

Real time analytics Time series Database,"I'm looking for a distributed Time series database which is free to use in a cluster setup up mode and production ready plus it has to fit well in the hadoop ecosystem.I have an IOT project which is basically around 150k Sensors which send data every 10 minutes or One hour, so I'm trying to look at time series database that has useful functions like aggregating metrics, Down-sampling, pre-aggregate (roll-ups) i have found this comparative in this Google stylesheet document  .I have tested Opentsdb, the data model of the hbaserowkey really suits my use case :  but the functions that sill need to be developed for my use case are :I have tested also keirosDB which is a fork of opentsdb with a richer API and it uses Cassandra as a backend storage the thing is that their API does all what my looking for downsampling rollups querying multiples metrics and a lot more.I have tested Warp10.io and Apache Phoenix which i have read here  that it will be used by Ambari Metrics so i assume that its well suited for time series data too.My question is as of now what's the best Time series Database to do real time analytics with requests performance under 1S for all the type of requests example : we want the average of the aggregated data sent by 50 sensors in a period of 5 years resampled by months ?Such requests I assume can't be done under 1S so I believe for such requests we need some rollups/ pre aggregate  mechanism, but I'm not so sure because there's a lot of tools out there and i can't decide which one suits my need the best.I'm the lead for Warp 10 so my answer can be considered opinionated.Given your projected data volume, 150k sensors sending data every 10 minutes, it is a mean of 250 datapoints per second and less than 40B on a period of 5 years. Such a volume can easily fit on a simple Warp 10 standalone, and if you later need to have a larger infrastructure you can migrate to a distributed Warp 10 based on Hadoop.In terms of requests, if your data is already resampled, fetch 5 years of monthly data for 50 sensors is only 3000 datapoints, Warp 10 can do that in far less than 1s, and doing the automatic rollups is just a matter of scheduling WarpScript code in a monthly manner, nothing fancy.Lastly, in terms of integration with the Hadoop ecosystem, Warp 10 is on top of things with integration of the WarpScript language in Pig, Spark, Flink and Storm. With the Warp10InputFormat you can fetch data from a Warp 10 platform or you can load data using any other InputFormat and then manipulate them using WarpScript.At OVH we are heavy users of @OvhMetrics which rely on Warp10/HBase, and we provide a protocol abstraction with OpenTSDB/WarpScript/PromQL/... I'm not interested in Warp10, but it has been a great success for us. Both on the scaling challenge and for the use cases that WarpScript can cover.Most of the time we don't even leverage hadoop/flink integration because our customers needs are addressed easily with the real time WarpScript API.For real time analytics, you can try , an open source project maintainted by Apache, or you can also check out database specialized for IoT:  and . The best way is to test these databases yourselves and see if they suit your need. You can also connect these databases as a sink to Kafka.

Cordova builds AppxManifest.xml, resources.pri file and .appxrecipe and since I was able to select only one file in the web interface I added appxrecipe.Any help would be appreciated since I dont see many questions about creating windows app for iot core using cordova.Edit: I tried ""cordova remove platform windows"" and readding it again doesnt work. The project works on physcial android device/google emulator/riddle/windows app on my local machineAfter many tries I managed to fix the problem.
I needed to build the application as uap (Universal app)
""cordova build windows -- --appx=uap""Than I manually added the appx file and the certificate via WindowsIOT user interface and it installed successfully! Now I am able to run the application without problem :)Edit: Screenshot: You may also add the configuration to your config.xml for cordova:value can also be set to UAP as well.","After many tries I managed to fix the problem.

how to communicate between openmote and arduino?,"I'am working on an IOT project. The goal is to communicate between two openmotes (one is the server and one is the client). When the client receives some data, it is supposed to pass it to an arduino to activate different controllers (like a motor, some leds ...). So, I wanna send data from a openmote to an arduino. The idea is to use a bus. The openmote is the master and the arduino is the slave. Do you have any idea how to do this ? I can't find any documentation fro the open mote part. I thought about using the serial UART but i don't have any idea how to do that. Thank you !If anyone is looking for an answer, it is possible to activate the UART 1 on the open mote and to send data to the arduino using that bus.

Creating nested IoT field gateways with Azure and AWS,"From what I have read and understood from their documentation is that only single layer IoT hierarchies can be maintained with either of their gateways. That is a field gateway(sort of like a smart router) sits between the server and edge devices and does the preprocessing and edge computing.What I am wondering is whether field gateways provided from either vendor(AWS or Azure) can be nested as parent and children to create multi-layered IoT device hierarchies. That is gateways connected to gateways and so on.EDIT - This kind of hierarchies would create Fog networks which would enable sub-networks within the hierarchy to function more independently without being over-reliant on the server. Also, they'd reduce the load on the server if the edge gateway could do edge computing while reducing latency as well.Currently the edge device only able to communicate with Azure IoT Hub directly. It doesn't support nest multiple Azure IoT Edge gateways.However, this capability is planning on adding to the product. This feature will be considered in the future but unfortunately there is no timeline yet.","Currently the edge device only able to communicate with Azure IoT Hub directly.

How to reach my IOT device from everywhere without static IP,"I am able to access to my IOT device if I assign it a static IP with a service like dydns. But I would like to be able to reach it without relying on something.I was thinking that my IOT device could ,on every start, write in a database its IP adress so my script on the server knows its ip. The problem is that the IP will correspond to my hotspot IP. I am missing the connection part ""hotspot -->IOT device"".For example I would like to be able to connect my IOT device to my mobile phone in hotspot mode.One way to do this would be to re-design your system: if when it comes online the IoT device always connects (and stays connected) to a server component (which has a well-known/unchanging hostname/IP address), then the server can always send the IoT device a command over that TCP connection without knowing the hostname/IP address of the IoT device, and without it having to be contactable from the internet, i.e. this approach is firewall-friendly at the device end.This is how the IoT is architected when using e.g. MQTT: devices connect inwards to the MQTT broker (i.e. server). MQTT also removes the need for the server application itself to need to connect to the clients. MQTT uses a concept called publish/subscribe with pre-agreed 'topics' - the client will subscribe to a 'command' topic, the server app publishes commands to that topic and the broker handles forwarding the command to the device. Incoming data from the device is published to another topic and the server application subscribes to that topic, the broker forwards the published data. You can try pub/sub example (using a browser, but real devices can also connect to the same server) using e.g. ","One way to do this would be to re-design your system: if when it comes online the IoT device always connects (and stays connected) to a server component (which has a well-known/unchanging hostname/IP address), then the server can always send the IoT device a command over that TCP connection without knowing the hostname/IP address of the IoT device, and without it having to be contactable from the internet, i.e. this approach is firewall-friendly at the device end.This is how the IoT is architected when using e.g. MQTT: devices connect inwards to the MQTT broker (i.e. server).

Storing checkbox value on server side,"For my home automation project (using a Raspberry Pi with an Apache server and a configuration webpage) I'm trying to save a checkbox's setting to a file on the server side, but I can't get it working in my situation.
Using php with fopen() and fwrite() I can store any string into a text file, that's no problem. The issue is that the form uses POST and I can't seem to figure out how to write my code in such a way that:1) the checkbox itself is set to the value that is currently present in the text file ('remembering and retrieving' the setting);2) the setting that was just set by the user is written to the file, which happens when the page loads (POST).These actions seem to get in eachother's way because php is server side. If the page is refreshed or visited for the first time there's no problem, the problem exists in reloading the page after the form is submitted.
It doesn't really matter which method or language I use to save the checkbox's setting on the server side.Which method could do the trick?You can set the file by doing something like this, assuming that the file only contains the value 1 or 0 if the checkbox should be set or not (call this script when submitting the form):This is to put the checkbox in right format on screen.

On-screen keyboard in Windows Universal App on Windows IoT?,"Is it possible to show the On-Screen Keyboard (osk) in a Windows Universal App on Windows 10 IoT Core?
The raspberry pi only has a mouse attached and when I click on a textbox I'd like to show the osk.I can set the InputScope and IsTextPredictionEnabled but can't figure out how to trigger the osk to show.There is an example here of an on screen keyboard. If you look at the sample they are using one in their web browser. This is a pretty good keyboard but it would be better to have the default windows keyboardIf it was up to me I would prefer the default OSK since you can specify slightly different keyboard layouts based on inputs.

Using multiple beacons to articulate accurate user location,"Is it possible to find an accurate position of a person in a room using multiple Bluetooth beacons set up around the room through proximity detection? I've done some research and it says it is difficult to detect proximity with a Bluetooth sensor but can I overcome this through using multiple Bluetooth beacons?

I'm wondering if this idea is doable and am curious how I can achieve accurate proximity sensing with Bluetooth beacons.Thank you.For anyone who thinks of this idea in the future:Bluetooth really isn't ideal but there can be other ways such as using

ble_app_uart Can not be loaded completely on nRF 51822,"I have problem flashing main program and SoftDevice on the nrf 51822 module.

If so how can i fix it?Thank for your attention. After a while, I finally found out where the problem was laid.
I tried to change the ROM memory allocation for SoftDevice and main program and it finally works.Basically SoftDevice allocation must be bellow the main program in the memory. For example if we have memory form 0x00 to 0xff, The SoftDevice can be allocated from 0x00 to 0x2f and the remained area from 0x2f to the end must be reserved for main program.Depending on which SoftDevice(SD) you use eg. S110, S130 etc. , The size of SDs can vary So the memory allocation of SDs start from 0x00 but the ending point depends on which SD you use, So I changed the memory allocation address in Kiel, And can get information about SDs compatibility with nRF devices and SDs features in the site :  Here is another helpful link :","After a while, I finally found out where the problem was laid.

Our own web Services vs IoT`s APIs to have highest security,"I have two scenarios for implementing IoT devices and I want to know which one has most security? Because I am a programmer and I have bit knowledge on network issues is to implement IoT devices and have modification and configuration from outside of local network. Assume we have IoT device in smart house and I want to change its configuration from outside of house by changing some parameters.NOW: 
On the below picture indicates with red color on the left. Writing our own web services and make it accessible by setting up ""static ip"" and and using ""Port Forwarding"" + SSH in order to have high secure connection.In this story, user write static ip on address bar from outside of smart house and connect to web services and can have modificationnow my question is if this way can harmful for our firewall and network?
If this way open firewall port permanantly?
If all users can send request so do we have attackers that can attack other devices or not?We can have our authentication to have more safty. 
On the below picture indicates with blue color on the right. In this scenario we are using APIs from IoT company instead of writing our own services and user send request to IoT Company and on the our smart house we have gateway from IoT company which send request for instance per 1 second to check if ther is any on IoT company server or not and if there is any so make a modification.Because in this scenario Iot Company might to use DHCP IP instead of static ip , is it possible to have some hurt to fire wall?Because I am not sure but I think firewall will be opened whenever ther is any request so is it possible that this way is more secure? If possible, I would suggest not opening any port on the IoT device.

The routing server only tunnels the requests, but .My question is:What protocol should I use to implement this scheme?I am a little confused over .

Can MQTT broker be configured to send data to subscribers at a different rate?,"I am new to MQTT and working with the mosquitto broker and development libraries. I have a usecase where different subscribers may want to subscribe to a given topic but would want the data at different rates. So, subscriber1 may want it only on change from the previous value while subscriber2 may want it on a fixed cadence, say, every few mins/seconds.Is there a way to configure that in the mosquitto broker? Or any other broker that supports it?With or without MQTT, on PubNub you would need two separate channels: one for delta data and one for regular cadence data and there are three strategies you can employ.The clients wanting only the data changes would subscribe to . The subscribers wanting a regular cadence of data would subscribe to both  and .The publisher would publish data at the regular cadence on  and , publish to . So both types of subscribers get the data they want.Another option with PubNub, you could use  a meta-data value equal to ""1"" if the value has changed from the previous and ""0"" if the value is the same as the last value published. The values would only be published to one channel, .Clients that want all the data would subscribe like normal. But for clients that only want changes,  to only receive messages with that meta-data key set to ""1"". The client inits PubNub as usual, adds the listener (to receive published messages) and subscribes to the channel , but also sets a filter.And now this client will only have messages sent to it if the data has changed while the client without the filter will get all data that is published at the regular cadence.Using  the solution is very similar to the first. The publisher will publish values on a channel named  as long as the data is the same. If the value changes, it will be published to a channel named . The dots () in the channel names are important because clients will be able to subscribe using a wildcard - the asterisk ().Clients that only want changes in the value will subscribe to .And clients that want all of the value in a cadence will subscribe to both of the channels using a wildcard subscribe.This just means that data published to any channel that starts with  and has some  name - , ,  - will receive that data.No, there is no way to configure mosquitto (or any full fledged broker that I am aware of) to do that, it will deliver every message sent to a topic to all subscribers at the rate the publisher sends new messages.If you really must have this feature then the best you could do is probably take something like mosca () and use the hooks it provides to build your own broker, but it would be a nasty hack and it still wouldn't normally redeliver the same message if no new one had arrived for the constant cadence problemBut it would be so much easier to just keep a little state in the clients to throw duplicates away messages and and event loop that just processed the last message if a new one hadn't arrived yet.","With or without MQTT, on PubNub you would need two separate channels: one for delta data and one for regular cadence data and there are three strategies you can employ.The clients wanting only the data changes would subscribe to .

Why/when to use IoT publish/subscribe protocols rather then RESTful HTTP?,"I am sending data (GPS coordinates) from Arduino once a minute with HTTP POST request to REST API (in OpenShift PaaS). Data is then stored to MySQL db.Would so called ""IoT"" publish/subscribe protocols (XMPP, MQTT) be better? Why?When exactly do you use those two protocols rather than Restful HTTP? Would I really save a significant baterry energy using them?AFAIK in those protocols machine would ""publish"" a data to broker and my app would subscribe to it. If I would like to gather data every minute in my app I guess that I would got to have some CRON job that would subscribe to data every minute? Or how would data gathering be achieved?At small scale (not many sensors) or when the sensors have plenty of power (CPU and electrical), or communication cost is low then there's less reason to use MQTT. Conversely at large scale, or for CPU/electricity-limited sensors or when comms cost is high then MQTT or similar IoT protocol has advantages. You can implement MQTT in a very simple embedded CPU, more complex to implement HTTP.You would save battery power using e.g. MQTT over e.g. 3G because there is less protocol overhead from publishing MQTT data over a persisting TCP connection from MQTT client to broker then there is for every REST POST which usually requires establishing an SSL connection, posting the data using verbose HTTP, then deleting the SSL connection.An MQTT connection is inherently bidirectional (although your app doesn't have to use it) - so you natively get the ability to send commands to your sensors. To do the same using REST/HTTP you have to configure your server for long polling.There is a comparison of long-polling HTTPS vs MQTT over SSL here  which shows ~4.1% battery power/day saved using MQTT compared to slow-polling HTTPS
So yes, you can save significant battery energy.With MQTT you can send very small messages e.g. a few bytes of binary data, with low overhead. With REST/HTTP the data gets wrapped in a lot of HTTP protocol with much higher overhead. If you have lots of devices those overhead bytes add up to a lot more data being sent, which costs money. So at large scale using a compact protocol like MQTT and designing the data transfers carefully saves you money.With MQTT your app usually has a persistent subscription to the topics and is automatically notified of updates. If you want a summary every minute your app will save the updates to e.g. a DB and report from the DB. DB is usually needed to store all the data anyway. You can subscribe to wildcard topics - this means you design your topics so your app subscribes to e.g. all solar sensors and the broker will send data for all the connected devices without your app having to poll the individual sensors.","Would so called ""IoT"" publish/subscribe protocols (XMPP, MQTT) be better?

A web application on a cloud provider could easily be setup to both autoscale and cover multiple regions, but it is still something you would have to setup and manage yourself. It would likely also be more expensive to provide the same performance as the platform services does, they are built for millions of devices across a large number of customers, their solution will likely look different under the hood.Third is time-to-market, by going with a platform service will get you up and running with your IoT solution fairly quick as opposed to building it yourself. Figure out what requirements you want to support, how you want to scale, how many devices and so on. Then you can do a simple comparison of price and also what it would cost you to build the features you need.","Of course you can implement your own IoT hub on any web application and cloud (or on-prem) platform, there is nothing secret or proprietary in those solutions.

This problem, though, seems inherently functional.  Can I accomplish this using lazy enumerator in ruby?This doesn't produce exactly your desired output - it skips the last item of the run. But the good news is you don't need the last item, because you know its value is the same as your first item, and you know its timestamp is one less than the next item.

Measure CPU speed of IoT devices at different temperatures,"I want to measure the computational speed of a telosB at different temperatures. To program the device I use contiki. 
My idea was to let it send messages in fixed intervals with the return of as content. A second device reads that message and stores it in a file, together with its own clock_time (void) return value. With that I could say:At temperature A, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 600 clock ticks to receive 100 messages.At temperature B, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 800 clock ticks to receive 100 messages. This would mean that the device truly is slower at temperature B, because the receiver had to wait longer. I am stuck right now, because I get different results every time I perform my solution + the results get distorted at the moment the link quality is not perfect and some packages are getting lost.
Is there a solution, maybe with a different setup, that helps me to prove the idea?If you want to measure deviations in the frequency of a clock, use a .

If you're running your device at extreme enough temperatures that clock speeds are drifting by even a few percent, this is likely to prevent radios from operating, as their transmit/receive frequency will drift as well.You can send the messages with constant interval between them (e.g. every 5 milliseconds in A's time), and add a sequence number to the each messages. This way, you will know the expected time of each received message relative to the previous messages, even if some messages are missing.To measure the CPU speed, you don't really need to measure the time to receive and process each message.

The normal method that I would use is to have a timer that uses the crystal to generate an event that triggers the main loop software to send out the message at a defined periodicity.

Best practice to create automatic reports with Cumulocity,"I am wanting to create automated reports using the data I have collected with Cumulocity. I would like to automate the creation of the reports so that they aggregate accumulated timeseries, alarm & event data into a single report that could be automatically sent to relevant parties by e-mail on a fixed time interval (weekly, for example).I understand how to do this with the APIs that Cumulocity provides, but I am interested in experiences of more specific implementations (I imagine I am not the first person thinking about this). Should the data that I want to aggregate be retrieved with CEL (Cumulocity Event Language) and then the report created in the desired format (pdf) with my own script? Is it possible to host this kind of script in Cumulocity or do I have to host it myself?There is a quite new feature related to the reporting in cockpit (excel/csv export).

Once you have the subscription, you can send some data from your device, then on commandline you can run (assuming you have the gcloud tools installed):To do anything with the messages, you can script subscribing to the Pub/Sub topic (check out the Pub/Sub APIs) to trigger on messages being added to the topic.:Are you sending a config message to the device? The confusion might be that the MQTT topics are one-directional.So: 1) the /events topic is for device->IoT Core. 2) the /config topic is for IoT Core Admin SDK->deviceIn another script somewhere, or from the IoT Core UI interface you need to send a configuration message to see the on_message fire properly.In the IoT Core UI (on console.cloud.google.com) you can drill down to an individual device you have registered, and at the top of the screen, click on ""Update Config"". A popup window will come up that lets you send a text or a base64 encoded message to that device and it will come in on the /config topic.I had to surrender to Google Pub/Sub library in order to receive notifications related to my specified topic.My publish code (only the important parts):In the Google Cloud Platform portal, I had to create a subscription, in the Pub/Sub section, assigning it to my created topic, which was already my default topic (probably linked to /events topic). The created subscription has the following format: My subscribe code, using the Google Pub/Sub library, since it is not possible to use the MQTT protocol:I hope this can help anyone.

Cumulocity data export,I noticed a limit of 2000 records per API call for getting collections out of Cumulocity. Will we be constrained to these limits or is there any other batch API available?You cannot get more than 2000 records for a single collection request at the moment. But you can specify a more direct query e.g. by time and grab it in multiple requests if it exceeds the 2000 records.Example:Another way would be to get data continuously pushed to you. You can use the real-time API ,You cannot get more than 2000 records for a single collection request at the moment.
