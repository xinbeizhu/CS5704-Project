"Android studio, reading data from Azure IoT Hub","I am using the java android_sample taken from azure-iot-hub
Basically i have a Raspberry pi that sends data with a python script to the Azure iot hub.As you can see from the picture, the IoT hub is receiving the data.In Android studio, as said, I am using the android_sample code.
I added a button and textview etc... To show the data.Now, when I go to the ""Messages to Device"" tab and send data everything works. My phone is receiving that data, and displaying it.The problem is that I want the data from the ""data"" tab. When I start the Pi script, and then the android app, it's not receiving the data that the pi is sending.When I ""send"" something from the device explorer, it is receiving that data.if you need some code I will post it, but i'm basically using the example code, just modified a bit.Your android app can receive data sent from device explorer because these are Cloud-to-Device data. While it can't receive data sent from the Raspberry Pi because these are Device-to-Cloud data. It is expected.More information you can reference .For your use case you can reference .

Lost ability to read files Windows IOT,"I've been developing an app on a Raspberry Pi running Windows IoT.  I have code that successfully could read and write files from the documents folder.  Lately, I've mostly been working on the app on my local machine, since the development cycle is faster.When I went to try to run the code on the Pi again, my program could no longer see the files in the document folder.  Figuring I messed something up, I rolled back to an earlier version of the code that worked.  I got the same result.  For reference this is the code I'm using:The StorageFolder variable seems valid, but I get null for samplefile.  If I run I see the files listed.  I'm at a loss on why earlier versions of the code don't work.  The only things I can think of are:Has anyone come across a similar problem?  Thanks.I figured it out.  The files I was trying to read in were csv files.  After I brought each file into Excel and saved it and moved it back to the Pi, the app started working again.  I'm not sure why the contents of the file were prohibiting the file from being seen.  I'm going to look at the files with a hex editor to find any differences.","I figured it out.

How to supply event coordinates for real-time insights events?,"When we look at the IoT Real-Time Insights service, we see that it provides a visual mapping capability.  Unfortunately, the current documentation on using this appears to be very light.  What should the JSON string structure of an incoming event contain to provide latitude and longitude data to the Map widget within a Real-Time Insights dashboard?References:During the creation of an IBM IoT Real-Time Insights environment, one must build the schema that describes the content of an incoming event.  Within an event, we get to specify ""data points"" which are basically the fields within the incoming event.  When we define a data point there is an attribute of it called ""Sensor type"" which is presumably used to provide a ""hint"" as to what kind of sensor produced that field in the event.  Contained within this set are two pre-defined values called  and  and these provide the core of the answer.  When we define the schema of an incoming event and we know that two arbitrarily named fields that we have chosen will contain the latitude and longitude information for a geospatial position, we need to define them as having the sensor types appropriate for their purpose.  Here is an example screen shot illustrating a definition:Notice specifically the value of ""Sensor type"".The JSON structure is not really important as long as the message includes two data points, one representing lat and one long. By configuring these data points with the data type Float and the sensor types  and  in the Message Schema you enable the Map widget to use these as latitude and longitude coordinates.Sample IoT Phone JSON structure that includes lat and long data points:","During the creation of an IBM IoT Real-Time Insights environment, one must build the schema that describes the content of an incoming event.

Perform queries over the time-series stream of data,"I'm trying to design an architecture of my streaming application and choose the right tools for the job.This is how it works currently:
Messages from ""application-producer"" part have a form of  tuples. I've already implemented all functionality before Kafka, and now I've encountered major flaw in the design. In ""Spark Streaming"" part, consolidated stream of messages is translated into stream of events. The problem is that events for the most part are composite - consist of multiple messages, which have occurred at the same time at different sensors. I can't rely on ""time of arrival to Kafka"" as a mean to detect ""simultaneity"". So I has to somehow sort messages in Kafka before extracting them with Spark. Or, more precisely, make queries over Kafka messages. Maybe Cassandra is the right replacement for Kafka here? I have really simple data model, and only two possible types of queries to perform: query by address, and range query by timestamp. Maybe this is the right choice? Do somebody have any numbers of Cassandra's throughput?  If you want to run queries on your time series, Cassandra may be the best fit - it is very write optimized, you can build 'wide' rows for your series. It is possible to make slices on your wide rows, so you can select some time ranges with only one query.On the other hand, kafka can be considered as a raw data flow - you don't have queries, only recently produced data. In order to collect data based on some key in the same partition, you have to select this key carefully. All data within same partition are time sorted.Range Query on Timestamp is the classic use case of cassandra , if u need address based queries as well u would have to make them as clustering column if using cassandra . As far as cassandra througput are concerned if you can invest in proper performance analysis on cassandra cluster you can achieve very high write throughput . But I have used SparkQL , Cassandra Driver and spark Cassandra connector they don't really give high query throughput speed until you have a big cluster with high CPU configuration , it does not work well with small dataset .Kafka should not be used as data source for queries , its more of commit log","If you want to run queries on your time series, Cassandra may be the best fit - it is very write optimized, you can build 'wide' rows for your series.

Not able to add device in IBM bluemix?,"I am not able to add Raspberry Pi to IBM Bluemix. I have generated the access keys and followed all the steps. But when I click on the portal add a device, it asks for device types on creating new one I am still not able to add the device. Has the device adding process changed in new IBM Bluemix portal because none of the recipes defines it. Please provide the latest steps if someone has.Yes, there was a change in the device portal. Previously there may have been a drop down that had raspberry pi as an option.  Now if you want to add a device and don't already have a raspberry pi device type defined just click ""add device"" 
then ""create device type""  and add the info to define your device.  Note that the metadata field is optional.  Once you have gone through the steps to add ""device type"", that type will then be available to select when you add device and you can choose it as the type to add, then click next and the screen will have a place to add device ID.
I am adding a few screen shots for reference. 
Your device id would be the mac address of the Raspberry pi ( without the colons ). e.g: A mac address would be b8:27:eb:98:46:0a, and the device id would be b827eb98460a. Hope this helps.","Yes, there was a change in the device portal. Previously there may have been a drop down that had raspberry pi as an option.

Why oBIX and CoAP together required,"I am working on an building automation IOT system which has both oBIX and CoAP application to provide web services. As per my knowledge CoAP layer operates above oBIX handler. Also some interfaces of oBIX is similar to CoAP.My query is why oBIX is required? Why oBIX is necessary if CoAP is already avaliable?In IOT, CoAP is used as Binding protocol for oBIX interfaces. The oBIX specification provides for bindings using REST (using HTTP or CoAP), SOAP, and WebSocket to talk with web/internet.In many cases, your choice of binding may be dictated by the application needs, such as if you are implementing a server in a constrained environment, or for an enterprise level application.For CoAP binding following CoAP intefaces are mapped with oBIX requests:
Read - - - - - - - - - GET

HomeKit issues when using HMCatalog app,"I'm currently working on a mobile app for a HomeKit compliant accessory. I am using the HMCatalog app and the HomeKit Accessory Simulator for testing purposes. The issue I'm seeing involves my mobile app and the HMCatalog app. I was under the impression that HomeKit syncs through a user's iCloud account. When I am signed in with my iCloud account on one phone (Phone A), any Homes/Rooms/Accessories that I add on in the Catalog on Phone A will show up in my mobile app on Phone A.However, when I use Phone B, and sign into the same iCloud account, I don't see the same data in Phone B that was in Phone A. The information appearing in HM Catalog appears it is staying on the individual device and not being stored in iCloud.Has anyone else seen this? Is this an issue with HomeKit? With the Catalog app?I found that with HomeKit there are some propagation issues. Sometimes it depends on the network you are in (some block _hap services).Best way to test it is with a local USB dongle and put the accessories in the dongle network. This should limit the propagation issues.Hope it helps.I faced the same issue and was pulling my hair on this one. It's an iOS issue, and after a lot of agonizing hours, this worked for me:See the following thread. It should be fixed in iOS > 8.1 however, may appear intermittently.","I found that with HomeKit there are some propagation issues.

IoT Hub Gateway availabillity,"I heard there is an IoT Hub Gateway.

what is the best scenario for implement detection of empty space to park cars in the parking lot? [closed],"I have a project to detect the empty space for parked cars in the parking lot.When a person enters the parking lot with a car, he faces a series of green and red lights above each parking lot.
There is a sensor above the head of any park location with 2 green and red lights.If a car parked in a car, the sensor detects the car and lights its red light to the fullness of the place.
If the sensor detects the location empty, that is, the car did not park under it, it lights up its green light as an empty parking spot.
Now that the driver sees the green lights, he will know where there is space for the park.
Now, I want to know what is the best scenario in your view to implementing this project? Do you recommend using a central system using a robust firewall or using multiple Arduino modules for each sensor?
Thank you for your guidance.They are different things. Raspberry PI is a computer, arduino is just a microcontroller with peripherals as facilities. Raspberry runs an Operational System inside, Arduino doesn't. Raspberry has a digital-only set of electrical interfaces. Arduino has both analog and digital.Depend on the project needs one or other is more suitable. Since IoT have infinite scenarios of applications, each one with its requirements and features, in general it is impossible to define what is better for IoT.","They are different things.

How IoT devices connect to servers,"I am working on IoT project, and I should keep the embedded device to be connected with a web-service. So, which is better, requesting the webservice every 1 or 2 seconds, or opening a socket with the server to guarantee the real time operations.Taking into Consideration that working with sockets, may require me to write a lot of bunches of codes, as there's no frameworks for socket over ARM for example.ThanksMy team and I are currently working on an IOT platform, here are my suggestions:After all, you need to make your choice on your product's requirements.You can use MQTT protocol, its library is available for embedded c as well as for arduino.
Also you can choose, Rest/Coap with nodejs as the request will be waiting until node will give response
In this both scenario, real time communication can be approached without any socket and refreshing time.","My team and I are currently working on an IOT platform, here are my suggestions:After all, you need to make your choice on your product's requirements.You can use MQTT protocol, its library is available for embedded c as well as for arduino.

Sensors monitoring using Python on Rapsberry,"I would like some help to find the best way to code a Raspberry python program.In this program, I need to monitor several values coming from various sensors connected to the raspberry, and interact with these values from a pyqt GUI. The GUI and the sensors drivers have to be completely separated.To do that, I was considering to make and use a ""Variable Manager"" object between the GUI and the sensors, as a ""buffer"" or something like that. With the use of threads and locks, the sensors would update continuously the Variable Manager (with while loops in the corresponding drivers), while the GUI would query certains values whenever I need.It would be also nice to be able to send some commands to the sensors from the gui but I don't know how to do that in this configuration.Do you think that this could work correctly ? Is there any other way more efficient / more adapted to do that ?Thank you a lot in advance ! I would do it like this:[Physical Sensors] --> [Python Sensor Monitor] --> [PubNub / similar]Then your GUI can use a PubNub consumer to get the data as it's streaming and inspect/do stuff.

Arduino To SQL Server,"Anyone who can Help me, Please tell me How to send ultrasonic detection readings from Arduino to SQL Server using Ethernet Cable? Need Code or Helping material or Link. I don't want to send it by using any Wifi module to Arduino just by using Ethernet Cable.If you want to send it to sql server using the arduino, you have one of two options. (And I think really only one) For both, you will need to write Arduino code that can talk to an external server.You can find info on that Next, you will need to decide if you want to send it directly to a SQL Server, or if you want to send it to a RESTful Web API, and have that API write the data to SQL Server. The first option will require you to write your own implementation for TDS over TCP. TDS is the protocol SQL Server uses to send and recieve database queries. You can find info on SQL Server and the TDS protocol This option will be a lot of work, and I am not sure that you will have enough room on the arduino to fit all of the code that would be required for even just a dirty, minimal implementation. Nevermind a reliable, quick, and safe one.Your other option would be to implement a way to send HTTP Requests over TCP using the arduino. This would allow you to talk to a Web-based REST API. The API would act as a middle man, taking HTTP GET or POST Requests from the arduino, and translating them to SQL Server by means of some database driver. As far as implementing HTTP with the arduino, you can do that with precreated libaries, like As far as what you would use for an API, that can be any Server Side programming
language. I personally recomend using ASP.NET to create the API, and ADO.NET to talk to the database. There is lots of documentation all over the net on both of these subjects. A good place to start would be  for a Web API and  for information on ADO.NETFor those still interested about the topic, I shared a bare-bone implementation of TDS 7.0 which I made back in days. It was tested on Arduino Nano and Arduino Mega. Although very obsolete, this might give you an idea how to implement it if you choose to do so.

IBM Watson IoT platform: Missing feature in device management framework?,"I am using device management framework of IBM Watson IoT platform. One of the key client requirements is that firmware should be installed (aka updated) in device as soon as it is downloaded. Currently I am not able to figure out a good way to fulfill that requirement using WIoTP. That is I am not able to find a way in which my application will be notified by WIoTP when download completes on the device. I am left with polling using REST APIs, but that leaves some gap between download and update. In addition it creates an overhead. I tried subscribing to different MQTT topics mentioned  for an application, but don't see any message coming in for device management statuses. Basically am not able to find the feature of an app. being notified when a device completes download of firmware. Am I missing something or is the feature currently missing in WIoTP?The only other way I think I can make this happen is for the device to publish download complete message to another topic. The application can then subscribe to this topic and get notified. But this is again a hack.Currently there is no way other than the hack you suggest or polling.  Very shortly (days rather than weeks) there will be an update that allows you to pass  params in the  action.  This should solve your issue as there will be no need for polling between download and update.  The docs at the link mentioned by Valerie will be updated to reflect this when its available and there will be an update here:It could still be useful to be able to observe the communications between IoTP and the device using an API key, which would negate the need to poll for action completion.

Is there an autonimus realtime clock wilth month loss less than 10milliseconds?,"Looking for a realtime clock for IoT project. Need a millisecond resolution for my app protocol and its loss is critical. So I wonder if there is an  autonimus realtime clock (with a battery) that will loose less than 10ms per month and work for a year?The drift parameters you're asking for here -- 10 ms / 30 days -- imply <4 ppb accuracy. This will be a very difficult target to hit. A typical quartz timing crystal of the type used by most RTCs will drift by 50 - 100+  (50,000 - 100,000 ppb) just based on temperature fluctuations.Most of the higher-quality timing options (TCXO, OCXO, etc) will not be usable within your power budget -- a typical OCXO may require as much as 1W of (continuous) power to run its heater. About the only viable option I can think of would be a GPS timing receiver, which can synchronize a low-quality local oscillator to the GPS time, which is highly accurate.Ultimately, though, I suspect your best option will be to modify your protocol to loosen or remove these timing requirements.Sync it with the precise clock source like GPS for example. You can also use tiny atomic clock or in Europe DCF77 receiver.","The drift parameters you're asking for here -- 10 ms / 30 days -- imply <4 ppb accuracy. This will be a very difficult target to hit.

IoT Python application architecture with Flask on Raspberry Pi [duplicate],"I've started working with Raspberry Pi and I've faced with architecture problem.
I want to make python app which blink the LED using GPIO and have Web interface to start and stop blinking.
In the Web there are a lot of examples of how to use Flask to make one action (e.g. enable LED, disable LED etc.) but I haven't found example how to run Flask web server and also run parallel ""job"" to blink LED or in general to run action by timer.One solution is to have different applications for that 2 purposes. One for blinking. And one for Flask server. But this approach requires a database to share data between applications, I wouldn't like to do it in IoT device (Raspberry Pi). So I'd prefer single monolitic app.Could anyone help me with idea how to run action by timer within Flask application?
Here is pseudocode to show what I expect.Thanks for any ideas!If I understand it right, you are looking for something running in the background;The main idea behind this would be creating a thread or a task that runs in the background that checks a flag to either go into blinking mode or turn it off.
Basically the flask endpoint would just set that flag and your background task would check it and act accordingly.Another option would be Flask schedulers that way you can schedule how and when to run those tasks.Also threadpool executors","If I understand it right, you are looking for something running in the background;The main idea behind this would be creating a thread or a task that runs in the background that checks a flag to either go into blinking mode or turn it off.

Transform a double into a 32-bit representation (and reverse procedure),"

What is difference between TinyDTLS and DTLS,"all.
I'm checking dtls library. I've found some libraries for dtls implementation.

But, I have no idea which functionalities is limited for tinydtls. Can you please let me know which functionalities is limited from general dtls and what exactly difference between dtls and tinydtls?tinydtls doesn't support X.509 certificate (probably not a big deal to add it).Also it's designed for 6LowPAN, it tends to not aggregate handshake messages in the same UDP packet but in multiple packets.
It's supporting only the CoAP oriented ciphersuite (ex: AES CCM-8)
Resume is also not supported.Outside of that, it's really compact and the code is clear.mbed tls or gnu tls also implement DTLS","tinydtls doesn't support X.509 certificate (probably not a big deal to add it).Also it's designed for 6LowPAN, it tends to not aggregate handshake messages in the same UDP packet but in multiple packets.

Any current users of other M2M sim cards your opinions and feedback would be very much appreciated.I propose working with local MNO which has strong coverage in rural areas as well. It could be more cost effective option and would be showcase opportunity for MNO in M2M domain. You can ask them to provide prepaid numbers with only GPRS as active service. They can create monthly renewal data package and assign it to one main account, other numbers are assigned as child account. All accounts including main account consume the data balance together from main account. With monthly top-up, numbers can stay active and provide data service to your M2M project. As I remember even 10 years ago, creating group accounts with common consumption concept was available in MNO billing systems, probably your national MNOs have it on their system.

Mosquitto vs eclipse paho client library,"I'm just looking into the details of Eclipse  and  client libraries (MQTT C++ libraries). It looks like the PAHO uses the mosquitto MQTT broker but provides its own MQTT client libraries. Also the  library provides a way to implement client libraries for Mosquitto MQTT broker.I would like to understand what's the main difference between these two client libraries.  it is discussed but that does not answer my question. Which is preferred over another and why? and why eclipse supports both? I'm facing the same issue, whether to pick  or  c++ client library for an embedded linux device. I tried first a minimal application with PAHO. It basically supports all the features I need, but the cpp-library-wrapper does not and I feel like the main project branch  is not maintained very well. 
Since there are two features which are not offered through the mainBranch cpp-lib in PAHO, I'm going to use  with  wrapper now.
So as you see my decision is related to the cpp-library only. But like you I'm still interested to get to know what are the differences between the underlying C-libraries.We have used Paho C library and Java library.  If you look at the Paho C code, the code quality is poor.  With the Java library, we experienced a problem where Linux deletes a temp file and Paho does not recover - don't know if that affects the C version.  Trying libmosquitto for next project.","I'm facing the same issue, whether to pick  or  c++ client library for an embedded linux device. I tried first a minimal application with PAHO.

Sawtooth may more easily manage the volatility of the network addressing. In your situation the utility of a DLT is unclear. :
Hyperledger Sawtooth uses a Merkle Radix Tree to enforce state agreement. That means that when transactions are exchanged amongst those nodes, each node will check if it has reached the same internal database state as the other nodes.
See Quorum as a Go Ethereum fork has a similar mechanism. However that trie is split to represent public ethereum network state and whatever private state is being managed on the side chain. According to Quorum's docs the endpoints must be known apriori. That may be difficult for your proposed network if the IP addresses change when the nodes gain and lose connectivity.
This will also be difficult for Sawtooth if all the addresses change. If at least one node remains consistent then the topology can be rebuilt dynamically. Sawtooth includes different protocol options including dynamic peer discovery.If I'm interpreting your use case correctly, you are suggesting that blockchain nodes would feed their independent views of data into a centralized server.

"In the MQTT protocol, how does a client identify a server?","I have read that the overhead is low. What does it really mean when compared to HTTP? Does it not use the ip address of the server to which a client tries to connect to? If not, how does a client connect to a server?Low overhead means that for a given size of messages there is very little extra information sent. It has nothing to do with broker discovery.E.g. for a HTTP message there us a relatively large amount of HTTP Headers sent before any of the message is transmitted.The client will connect to the broker via it's IP address. This can either be known in advance, looked up from a host name via DNS or looked up via a TXT record in the DNS for a given domain.

"Contiki OS - Selective Forward Attack, trying to edit uip6.c","I am trying to implement an intrusion detection system(IDS) for IoT, and now I want to implement a selective forward attack to test the IDS. To do this, I want to drop all packets that are not destined for that specific node or is not RPL control messages.

However, because I want some nodes to be ""nice"" nodes and some nodes to be malicious, I am struggeling to understand how to modify the uip6.c file for only the malicious file. I have tried to create seperate files, but I can not import the modified uip6.c file (I also created an modified uip.h file in net/ip/uip.h). Even though I in the malicious node include the modified uip.h file and not the original, the malicious node still forward the message from the original uip6.c file. Can someone explain why or explain other possibilites to how I can implement a selective forward attack?Thanks!I ended up using a attack_flag, that was set to one if the button was pressed. If the attack_flag was 1, do not forward the packet in uip6.c.

"ESP8266: Wifi gets connected, but no internet access","I am trying to connect my ESP8266 NodeMCU to my Mobile Hotspot WifiWhen I try to connect to the ESP Wifi using laptop, It says Wifi Connected, no Internet access.
Which means, The Wifi_SSID and Password are fetched by ESP correctly.Why is the ESP not able to connect to the Internet? I have used Arduino IDE for uploading code to ESP8266.
I have uploaded the below code to the ESP8266.Troubleshooting ESP8266 not connecting to WiFi
Failure to connect to the WiFi network can be caused by some factors. Among them I highlight:1 - The ESP8266 has a particularity of the initial state of its GPIOs during an initialization. As the intention is to make a connection to the Internet, I suggest that you leave the ESP8266 only with the power and communication connections. If you have a NodeMCU you can use only the USB cable.2 - Wrong filling in of the access data of the router will cause an error in the connection. Please note that you have to put in your code the WLAN SSID and WLAN PASS information, which are, respectively, the name and password of your network. It is worth remembering that the capture of these characters is case sensitive.3 - If your router is not connected to the Internet, then you will have feedback via the serial monitor of your local IP, but you will not have confirmation of access with the Google server. Test it with your smartphone or computer and check if everything is fine with your Internet connection.4 - It is difficult, but I have already seen incompatibility with the internet provider. To solve, test on different networks. I suggest that we carry out tests with your smartphone functioning as a WiFi router. You can even check the connected devices quickly and easily.You can learn more about it in this link (Eduardo Castro) in Brazilian Portuguese:

May be You need adjust pull-up resistors values. And try schematics with pull-down (not pull-up) like .Try enable pull-up for each pin or adding physical pull-up resistors. Say 1K ohm resistor attached between the pin and the 3.3V supply."
Do devices reconnect if IoT Hub restarts?,"I'm wondering if devices connected to an IoT Hub reconnect to it (or if they just crash) if IoT Hub for some reason stops and starts again after a while. E.g. if the subscription runs out.I've been trying to test this but can't find out how to stop my IoT Hub and restart it.There is no way to stop an IoT Hub. As mentioned , the IoT Hub will accept messages beyond the limits for a while, but at some point it will refuse the messages (i.e. returns an error). This is something you can detect in your device's code that is sending the events.You may try to setup a test account with small balance, when this account is overdue the IoT hub status is stopped. You can test under this situation.And for test purpose to stop IoT hub for a while you can vote up .","There is no way to stop an IoT Hub.

KairoDB metric names or tags for IoT,"We have a lot of sensors like energymeters and want to store the data using kairosdb. Before we used a simple SQL store, where each sensor has it's own table where each measurement is one row.a measturement is published to the system from the sensor via a JSON object:So, for example for two sensors on two devices, we have this in our DB:Sensor A1234:Sensor B5678:Now, we're investigating what's the best solution to store the same information but using KairosDB instead.Our goal is to answser some ""questions"" like: 
- the latest volt, watt, ampere 
- what was the average ampere between x (start timestamp) and y (end timestamp)
- what was the sum watts over all (or a subset) sensors between two datesand so on.So, what would be the best approach for choosing metric names and/or tags?Should we use the sensor-names for the metric names (without tags):Or should we use tags on the same metrics for all sensors:or, are we totally on the wrong way?Is there a difference regarding the query performance?it depends on your usage and in the tags cardinality.If you need to group-by sensor it's useful to have in tag.
If you always query sensors individually you will have simpler queries by having in the metric name.If the tags cardinality (number of time series for a metric) is too high it affects query performances (I would saw at hundred thousands+).
There are methods to overcome this impact by using an indexing/search plugin like the kairosDB SolR search ().I hope this helps.","it depends on your usage and in the tags cardinality.If you need to group-by sensor it's useful to have in tag.

MQTT on ESP8266 with NodeMCU - problems with publishing,"I'm building a battery powered IoT device based on ESP8266 with NodeMCU.
I use mqtt to periodically perform measurements and publish results.
I know, that to allow network stack running, I should avoid tight loops and rely on callback functions. Therefore it seemed to me that the right organization of my measurement code should be:The init.lua ensures, that the node has connected to the WiFi AP (if not, it retries up to 20 times, and if no connection is established, it puts the node on sleep until the next measurement time).
After WiFi connection is done, it calls the measurement function.The interesting thing is, that the above code doesn't work. There are no errors displayed in the console, but the mqtt broker does not receive published messages.
To make it working, i had to add additional idle time, by adding timers in the callback functions.The finally working code looks like below:The above works, but I'm not sure if it is optimal. To conserve the battery power I'd like to minimize the time before the node is put on sleep after the measurement is completed and results published.Is there any better way to chain the necessary calls to m:connect, m:publish, m:close and finally node.dsleep so, that the results are correctly published in the minimal time?Perhaps this was solved by more recent firmware.  I am working through a problem that I thought might be somewhat explained by this issue, so tried to reproduce the problem as described.My simplified test code is substantially similar; it calls dsleep() from the PUBACK callback of mqtt.Client.publish():and when run, does successfully publish to my MQTT broker.I am using:","Perhaps this was solved by more recent firmware.

Electro Mechanical Relay Input to Arduino,"I have a 220 V electro mechanical relay (Normally open by default).
I want to read input from Arduino  when my relay goes to normally close state from normally open or vice verson.
If I have more then 10 relay I want read 10 input from Arduino board.Is is possible if yes please explain.You can take the input of relay, read it via arduino to find the state of relay. 
most probably those relay are operating @ 12volts or more. make sure to change it to arduino compatible voltage(voltage divider or simple transistor would be fine for most cases).for your other part of question I did not understand it. Do you want to read only 10 inputs and neglect other or you want to read 10 inputs at a time?
both cases are possible.Usually relays have several contacts, you can connect unused contacts to arduino in 5V circuit. If your relay have no free contacts then add an intermediate relay with 2 contact groups. And use one group of contacts in your target schematic, second use for connecting to Arduino.
Generally talking there are lots of ways how to connect relay to Arduino. The choice depends of your current schematic, available equipment etc. You could place a magnetic reed switch next to the relay coil and use that to determine if the relay is energized.  That would keep the voltage separated and minimize modifications to the relay circuit.","You can take the input of relay, read it via arduino to find the state of relay.

Local blockchain vs. centralized database in a smart home environment,"I am working with a smart home (IoT) environment that creates sensible data and I want to secure the immutability by storing the hash of that data on a public blockchain.I want to use a local blockchain within the smart home environment to store data produced by IoT devices. The reason for using a private local blockchain instead of a public one is that I want to keep the user's data private.Another approach would be to use a centralized database system to store all the data of the smart home environment and take the hash of the entire DB to store it on the public ledger.The only benefit I could come up with is that the hash of the blockchain is already present whereas the hash of the centralized DB has to be calculated and could take a while.Blockchain does not only has a property of immutability but also have the property of distributed ledger, secure transaction, and pseudo-anonymous. Due to the distributed ledger, the data can be access at any time providing no zero downtime. All the transactions are verified and secure by the other nodes the verification is done with the help of Proof of Work done by the nodes.

What data / metadata can be read from a PIN protected SIM without entering the PIN?,"I am building a device with GSM Modem and a SIM card. I would like to protect the SIM card with a pin to prevent its misuse when the devices are installed on field.Storing the pin for associated SIM into each device would be cumbersome. Also, if SIM is replaced, I want the device to automatically know the PIN for the new SIM. So I was thinking of using a one way hash function to generate the pin from one or more properties of the SIM like its IMSI, ICCID, SIM Card Group Identifier, Service Provider Name etc.When a SIM is inserted, the device can dynamically calculate the correct PIN based on these properties.(I know that security based on secret algorithm violates the basic principles of computer security, but in this case I don't need it to be fool proof - I just need something better than leaving it unprotected.)The problem is that none of these properties can be read before entering the PIN.
Is there any other property that can be read without entering the PIN? Or do you have any work around that does not require storing of PIN on the device in advance?Yes, it should be possible to generate the PIN using the SIM properties itself (assuming you have relation with the card vendor and the operator). Regarding each properties that you mentioned:For the function itself, I propose using cryptographic hash instead only hash, to give more security. Additionally, you may also ask the card vendor to add additional proprietary file (EF), which you can put additional data inside (additional keys, bitmasks, key index of master keys to be used, etc).At the final step, do not forget to convert the cryptographic hash result into numeric format 4-8 digits.","Yes, it should be possible to generate the PIN using the SIM properties itself (assuming you have relation with the card vendor and the operator).

Cost effective way to connect microcontroller to internet (not wifi),"All I want to do is connect a microcontroller to the internet and send something to my server whenever the micro controller has moved. I don't want to connect to wifi but rather 3g or something of that nature. I am a software engineer not a hardware engineer so as long as it connects to the internet i can do the rest.Anybody know how I could do this? Consider using SIGFOX instead. It has good coverage in the US, and increasing coverage in the UK, and presents a low-cost alternative to communications using GSM. LoRa is another alternative.Both of these technologies are gaining traction as the IoT grows and satisfy different use cases.GSM/GPRS would allow you to connect to the internet at the cheapest cost of data bundles provided by your local subscriber, however, you could have a GSM fall back for SMS incase of poor connectivity or just create SMS to server pipeline instead of data.","Consider using SIGFOX instead.

IBM IoT Foundation: When to use MQTT and when to use REST for event submission?,"The IBM IoT Foundation allows devices to submit events to the IBM cloud for consumption and recording.  There appears to be two primary mechanisms to achieve the transmission of events ... MQTT and REST (HTTP POST requests).  Assuming that a project will have sensors with direct TCP connectivity to IBM cloud over the Internet, what might we consider as the potential distinctions between the two technologies?  What factors would case us to choose MQTT or REST as the technology to use?  Are there any substantial performance differences at the final mile at the IBM end that would say that one technology is preferred over another?MQTT is designed to be a fast and lightweight messaging protocol, and is as a result, faster and more efficient at this than HTTP when used to do the equivalent.  More efficient not only means less traffic data and more speed, but sometimes it can mean less electrical power as well.  MQTT is particularly good where bandwidth is a concern.MQTT does, however, need a client implementation (like Paho) which is possibly a rarer thing than an HTTP client implementation, which would be more ubiquitous and therefore more likely/easily available on any given device.  There are also TCP/IP port considerations, where some network hardware may require HTTP ports 80 or 443 (although IoTF supports MQTT and MQTTWS on port 443).There may also be an ideological or philosophical reason for choosing HTTP instead of MQTT (or COAP for that matter), but usually, I would say the reasons for choosing HTTP instead of MQTT would be network related or client support related.There is no official paper on the performance differences yet, but safe to say MQTT will be more efficient and faster given just about any messaging scenario (long lived connections or adhoc etc.)I would summarize the considerations as:","MQTT is designed to be a fast and lightweight messaging protocol, and is as a result, faster and more efficient at this than HTTP when used to do the equivalent.

Can AWS IoT device shadows work when communicating with device over HTTP(S)?,"The concept of ""Device Shadows"" introduced by AWS IoT is great for situations when devices have intermittent connectivity.However it seems that this requires for the device to subscribe to the messages from the remote ""cloud"" node (AWS IoT).

What could be causing this issue?The likely explanation is that you were a temporary member of your IoTF organization and that has subsequently expired.When you create an IoTF service using Bluemix, an IoTF organization is created and your IBM ID is added as a temporary member.  This temporary membership expires after 24 hours and the effect is similar to what you are describing.If you were to access IoTF using the service tile in Bluemix (Launch Dashboard) then you would be logged straight in to your organization.  At this point you will be able to add members (including yourself) to the IoTF organization and then be able to log in directly at The reason for this is that if a Bluemix user created an IoTF service, there is not necessarily the affirmation that that user will forever be authorized to access it.  By making that user a temporary member, it is able to log in directly for 24 hours only until the ID is added as a permanent member, or that user always accesses the IoTF dashboard using the Bluemix service tile.  The intention is that without positive action the user creating the service will still need access in Bluemix, in order to access IoTF.","The likely explanation is that you were a temporary member of your IoTF organization and that has subsequently expired.When you create an IoTF service using Bluemix, an IoTF organization is created and your IBM ID is added as a temporary member.

Can I use Node-Red to display one dashboard group per sensor?,"I'm playing around With Node-Red (I'm still in the newbie stages)I have around 20 ESP8266 modules taking temperature and humidity in various locations in and around my home.The way I am doing it right now, is to put a webserver on each of my ESPs and have node-red poll them every 5 Seconds.

My question is:Is there a way I can give node-red a list of the Devices (well, their IP addresses) and have node-red create my desired Dashboard for all of them?

"Node.js for IoT monitoring, optimization and system simulation","I am currently working on a project of real time monitoring, control and optimisation of a system (SCADA), in an Internet of Things context. 
The acquisition of the data and the control of the assets will be done through REST api and notifications from an IoT platform (Cumulocity or Predix, not sure yet), itself collecting measures from the sensors and sending operations to the equipment.The server application will then control the state of the system, set alarms, and make optimised decisions (plannings  for the equipment for instance). In order to test the behaviour of the system, the response to a decision and finding a good optimisation solution, I plan to also make a simulation of the system (maybe even a simulation of the real-time measures). Finally, an HMI in Angular JS will be provided to the user for him to enter the user input data, follow the current state of the system/alarms and its history, and be notified of the decisions made.I am not sure of the computation needed, but the  will probably be quite heavy, and the  solution may be a bit heavy too.A company would usually implement such an application in C, and it could also be done in Python ( is also needed), but I was thinking of doing it with Node.js.

accelerometer data while I stand and push my legs to jump.My goal is to use R to create a model which can identify jumps and how long I'm in the air.
I'm unsure how to proceed in such a challenge. I have a timeseries with accelerometer data. Some questions:Below is the R code used to create the graphs above, which is me standing and doing a simple jump.Thanks!This is probably less than perfect solution, but it might be enough to get you started. The first part relies on a small modification of the find_peaks function from the  package. In order to get the find_maxima and find_minima functions to give us what we're looking for we are going to need to smooth the total_gravity data even further:Note: I 'zeroed out' total gravity ()Next, pull out the smoothed x and y values:Then find our local maxima and minimaAnd then plot the data to make sure everything looks legit:And finally, we can see how long you were off the ground. You can reduce your thresholds to get additional datapoints (changes in acceleration).Hope this helps!I would consider a few things:There is code available in my github repository that could be modified to help with both of these issues.  A PDF with some explanation is here:  Specifically, take a look at:","This is probably less than perfect solution, but it might be enough to get you started.

Spring Boot application freezes after a day,"I have a Spring Boot application running on two servers. It accepts file  (approx 1 KB) via Controller from 1000s of IOT devices. Additionally there is a  which also accepts GPS data as a Stream from these IOT devices.I have setup the Tomcat max thread count to 3000 on one server and 5000 on a larger VM.After a day or two my Spring Boot application freezes, i.e. it stops responding to any further API calls.One reason, I suspect is that the IOT devices are  the TCP socket connection after sending the data. Where could I be going wrong? I am running out of threads to handle new incoming requests?After investigating the thread dump and adding logs during during Socket connection and closure, I have discovered that the IOT device isn't closing connections. Instead the device is creating a new connection every time it wants to send new data without closing the previous one.Before the app froze, 22500 open connections were automatically closed.How can I handle this behavior? Should I close the connections forcefully after a certain timeout?You can  mitigate the idle connections problem by hiding your service behind an Nginx or HAProxy which close idle connections by default after a given timeout.Another option is to set  in application properties (see ), but this appears to be applicable to HTTP only.","You can  mitigate the idle connections problem by hiding your service behind an Nginx or HAProxy which close idle connections by default after a given timeout.Another option is to set  in application properties (see ), but this appears to be applicable to HTTP only."

IOT with MEAN - Together,"MEAN stack and IOT are the current trending  hot topics. Can these two be used together? If yes then in what way?How can these technologies be used together?Sweta.By saying MEAN.js you are including things that are not strictly in the IoT terrain. Angular for example has little to do with anything. On the web front end you need to implement a javascript library like Paho.js that will use the MQTT protocol to connect to a broker and start aggregating messages from connected devices. Express has little to do as well as you are not exposing a Restful interface but connecting low level through a broker. A good solution in Node.js is Mosca. Mongo is good for dumping data from devices. I have written a  so have a look and you might find it interesting.Mean stack is the combination of the frontent web  frameworks like angularjs,emberjs,knockoutjs,backbonejs , javascript's backend server called nodejs and using the mongodb at top. so using these frameworks and library  will make a mean stack developer.
IoT pronounced as Internet of things. iot is recently used for connected electronics devices .basically it is a form of running your program inside the electronic chip and mostly trying to connect the devices.making control on devices using the programmed chip. there are separate IDE's are avaialble for developing and testing the programme on embeded chip.
you can use angularjs as a frontend(making your GUI) for your IoT'S application.As a fact is has been done before. And in other frontend frameworks too.  there is an example for home automation.
You can find even a  generator for such projects .To mention other places where you can find examples of current projects using MEAN to run IoT networks I encourage you to join angular, arduino and raspberry communities, as well as taking a tour over ,  and other maker sites such as the previously mentioned Netbeast .Yes you can make an IoT platform with the MEAN stack. Typically the sensors are low cost sensors and are constantly transmitting small amounts of data in MQTT or TCP protocols. With Node.js you can write, servers for such applications very easily. Mongo is useful if you have unstructured data, which could happen if you work with multiple sensors. If you don't need unstructured data structures, SQL is sufficient. All the data that you get from devices, finally needs to be consumed via applications. Express and Angular are great platforms to manage web applications.

Bridge Wifi to Raspberry Pi using Ethernet Cable,"I am not finding this question in SF history, which was a surprise, so I'll go ahead and ask it.I am working on an IoT Raspberry Pi project with Windows 10 and need to connect it to the internet via an Ethernet/USB adapter.  The adapter itself is made by Belkin.  Using this, I can see an ip of 169.stuff get generated for my Pi, which is a private ip.  I can deploy code to that from my connected box, however other devices are not able to reach it, and it is not able to make connections out to any servers.I'm wondering if anybody knows how to bridge the connection.I am attempting to use the new Azure IoT Hub and the SDK with this in case that makes any differences as that is not a simple rest interface and I believe is some form of socket connection.
I have installed a DCHP Server and the Pi gets the ip address: 192.168.0.3 assigned to it.  Unfortunately the Pi still can not ping external sites, such as google.com 
I am on a corporate box, which has internet sharing disabled by the system admin.  Following these instructions:  Fails.  It shuts down all connectivity to my box and I cannot ping anything or reach the internet or anything.Thanks,
~DavidThe 169 address means it isn’t getting a DHCP address assigned.  Since you don't have a router for the Ethernet, you can use Internet Connection Sharing, however we will need to run the following commands against the Pi to set a static IP, gateway, and dns server, since internet connection sharing botches this up a bit at times:You may need to reboot the Pi at this point then test pinging 8.8.8.8 and google.com to make sure resolution is working.  You should be all set!One other thing, if you have a group policy on the machine that is restricting Internet Connection Sharing then take a look at this article to fix the issue.  Note if your organization is constantly sending down the policy then you may have to re-enable Internet Connection Sharing often which is aggravating but at least it will work. 
 I do this by creating a DHCP server on my laptop and connecting the Pi directly to it. I followed  to get it working:Hope this works!

Requesting Guidance: What approach to follow to do Quality Control on small and thin metal ring shafts using Computer Vision?,"I am new to the Computer Vision field and looking for your guidance to identify approach to tackle the following scenario:Putting below the detailed requirement(this is the best I can share):To begin with, I have attached a picture of the ring we need to do QC of.Following checks we need to do:1.Surface coating of the ring peeled off2.Portion of ring chipped off3.Scratch on the ring's Surface4.Width of the ring is uneven5.Dent on the ring6.Entire surface of the ring is not completely horizontal to the plane; 
may be due to some dent a part of the ring is resting on the plane surface creating some 1 or 2 degree angle
(I have marked no.6 as 'uneven surface' in the attached picture)I have also attached another picture marking the quality issues found on a random ring.Scenario:Challenge:
- Need to set up a work station to capture image or video of each ring under checkFor the time being we are doing some research around opencv's background substraction methodsIt will be helpful to get some insight from you on 
what should be a better/feasible approachSince this is for a student project I'll emphasize image processing more than other aspects of an application. See the bottom section for considerations for real-world applications.That aside, a general comment: implementing vision for quality control (QC) is hard to get right. If the product to be inspected is cheap (e.g. a ring, a small plastic thing), and if the result of the vision inspection is a borderline pass/fail, or uncertain, you can reject the part. If the part to be inspected is expensive (e.g. a large assembly for a tractor, individual CPUs, medical devices near the end of the production line), then you have to have very well defined specifications, and the system needs to be made as robust as possible.In general, you want to optimize imaging for each type of defect. For example, the camera location, lens, and lighting to detect scratches may be quite different than what is needed for dimensional gauging (a.k.a. dimensional measurement).
When you search online for algorithms, equipment, and techniques specific to vision for industrial automation, including the quality control of parts on production lines, then for English-language websites favor the term ""machine vision"" instead of ""computer vision.""Machine vision is the common industry term for image processing (+ cameras + lighting + ...) for industrial use. Although different people may use different terminology, and the terminology isn't as important as learning techniques, you'll find a lot of material by searching for ""machine vision."" The term ""computer vision"" tends to be used for non-industrial applications, and for academic research, though in languages other than English the terms ""machine vision"" and ""computer vision"" may be the same. By comparison, ""medical imaging"" is similar to machine vision, but involves application of image processing to medical applications.Most importantly, you must control the lighting. Ambient lighting, such as desk lamps, overhead lights, etc., are not only useless for a vision system inspecting parts in production, but will typically interfere with image processing. You might find  defects sometimes with poorly controlled light, but to generate the most consistent results, you'll need to set up lights in specific locations, run the lights at specific, verifiable intensities, and have your vision system detect when something has gone wrong with the lighting.There are ""machine vision lights"" designed especially for specific applications such as finding scratches in shiny surfaces, making shiny surfaces look less shiny, to backlight parts (which is useful for dimensional gauging), to illuminate parts from low angles, and so on. Read about different types of lighting.Rather than spend a lot of money on special lights, you can mock them up:The importance of lighting can not be underestimated. Controlling lighting conditions improves the chance of success, and is typically necessary to achieve the accuracy of measurement or pass/fail assessment required in real-world environments.
At some point you'll probably wonder whether machine learning is useful or necessary for the application. The question to ask yourself (or the customer) is this: what percentage of defects would need to be detected?For example, if a chip is missing from the ring that could be a fatal defect. Is the ring used in some safety-critical application? If so, vision inspection for QC would have to be extraordinarily robust.Even if you're familiar with the terms ""accuracy"" and ""precision,"" make sure they have very clear meanings as you consider image processing problems:So, what percentage of chip defects needs to be found? 90%? 95%? 98%?Using the term ""accurate"" more loosely to mean ""the vision system gets the measurement correct and/or finds the defects we know are there,"" what is the accuracy of the most accurate machine learning algorithm you've read about? Or at least, what would qualify as reasonably impressive accuracy for machine learning? 95%? 98%?If you're making measurements of machine parts on a production line, then you would typically want the accuracy of dimensional measurements and defect detection to be 99% or better. For high-value products, and products such as electronic components that are highly sensitive to defects, accuracy may need to be 99.999% or better. Think of it this way: if a manufacturer is making thousands or tens of thousands of parts, they don't want garbage parts to make it past your vision system several times a day. Machine learning for image processing has been around a long time. Processing speeds, memory, and training set sizes have improved, and there have been improvements in algorithms as well, but it's important to note that machine learning is suitable only for some applications, and will fail miserably at other applications. Get the exact diameter, including tolerances. If the nominal diameter is 3.000 inches, then then tolerance might be expressed in terms of thousands of an inch. You may not need to know that for a student project, but if you were proposing a solution for a factory owner you wouldn't want to even suggest a price or timeline for delivery without having complete specs for the part, and numerous samples of the part.From the one image it's not possible to be too specific about what a defect might look like--the same part can have different defects in different factories, or even on different production lines of the same factory--but we can make some guesses.From the one image it's not clear what the surface coating is supposed to look like, or what's underneath. What is the surface coating? Anodization? Paint? Enamel? Plastic? Cheese? Whatever the case, knowing what material it is, and how that material degrades, will give some clues about what sort of vision setup may help detect problems with the coating. Changes in coating quality can affect apparent texture (e.g. edge content), brightness/darkness (intensity), color, shininess, and so on.For the moment, let's assume the coating peeling off changes the brightness or texture of the uncoated surface vs. the remaining coated surface. Then your image processing might look something like the following:It's hard to guess what technique would be relevant here without photos and/or a much more specific description of the coating. Hopefully this makes it clear why specs are important.Coatings can be absent in different ways: peeling, small absences (voids), partially scraped away, etc. It can be difficult to predict in advance what the shape and size of missing coating may be.When the size and shape of a defect is hard to predict, but when the defect is associated with a difference in image intensity (pixel brightness) or color, then explore these ideas:Once you have some basic algorithm that identifies the difference between good parts and parts with some missing coating, then you could consider using machine learning to review lots (lots!) of samples to help determine the best parameterization. For example, how do you know what number of edge pixels or edge pixel strength should be considered ""bad""? It depends on whether the chip is visible just from the part's outline. For example, if you placed the part on a light table (a.k.a. ""backlight""), would you  see a defect considered to be a ""chip""? Or could the chip just be on the top surface facing the camera?To find chips on edges, having the part on a backlight simplifies matters greatly.A simpler approach could be to fit a black-and-white mask--a template--representing a good part to the current location and rotation of the part to be inspected. If the template and sample part are aligned very precisely, and if you perform image subtraction, then you may be fortunate enough to get clusters or pixels where there are defects. But this method is fairly crude, and harder to make robust.There are machine learning techniques to identify chips on edges, but you'd need lots of part samples to train the techniques. Optionally, if you don't have enough samples, you can use the sample samples with slightly modified lighting, at different locations in the image, with manually added defects, etc., to help train the algorithm. But that's another discussion altogether.See the link above about different types of lighting. You'll need to experiment with a few different lighting configurations to figure out what works for your part.Generally, though, scratches are likely to have difference in brightness and ""edginess"" (image edge content) relative to the rest of the part. If you're lucky, a scratch can reveal a different color.Scratches can vary so much in appearance, area, and shape that it would be hard to parameterize an algorithm to catch them all. Once again, statistical analysis of edge content, brightness, and color tends to be useful.In general: to achieve the best results for a particular QC inspection, you'll need to engineer a system specifically for the part. Your vision system may be configurable, and there can be different combinations of lights and cameras for different types of QC inspection, but for any particular defect detection you want to control the appearance of the part as much as possible. Relying on software to do all the work yields a less robust system that customers will typically yank out and throw away.This is almost an example of dimensional gauging or optical gauging. If you're just looking for unevenness, you don't necessarily need to measurement diameter in engineering units such as millimeters: you can just measure pixels. BUT the effort required to ensure your measurement in pixels is accurate will typically lead you to measuring in millimeters anyway.Assuming the optical setup  is correct and (more or less) calibrated, which I'll describe below, here's a basic process:You might call a part ""bad"" for one or more of the following conditions:Measurement of distance depends on the consistency of point-to-point distances at different locations within the image. If you perform accurate, precise measurements of distance, you'll notice that an object of fixed length appears to vary in length depending on its location in the image: if the object is located in the center of the image it may appear to be 57.5 pixels long, but in one corner of the image it may appear to be 56.2 pixels long. To correct for these irregularities, you can...Use cameras imaging from the sides. Make sure the background is simple.A 1- to 2-degree difference could be hard to detect using a camera placed directed overhead. If you're lucky you could detect that the outer edge of the part is more elliptical than circular, but the ability to detect this would depend on the color and thickness of the part. Also, you wouldn't necessarily be able to distinguish between a misshapen part and one resting at an angle--but for some inspections that's okay since both are defects. HOWEVER, in a real-world application the customer might not be happy if you reject parts that are otherwise good, but happen to be sitting at a slight angle. A mechanical fixture might fix the problem by ensure parts are lying flat.The image isn't clear enough. Put the part on a simpler background and tinker with lighting to make it more obvious what the differences are between good and bad.Run one algorithm after the other. You may also have to turn different lights on and off before running each algorithm (or rather, each chain of algorithms).You may have to write an algorithm to detect whether multiple rings happen to be present. Even if you weren't asked to do this specifically, this happens in production, and your professor may surprise you with it. At least have an idea how you would detect the presence of multiple rings.That's another aspect of vision: you may start thinking of what algorithms and lighting are necessary to solve ""the problem,"" but you'll also spend a lot of time figuring out everything that could go wrong, and writing software to detect those conditions to ensure you don't yield a false result. For example, what happens if the lights turn off? What if two rings are present? What if the ring isn't fully within the field of view? What if dirt gets on the surface the part is resting on? What if the lens gets dirty (which it will)?A few principles:
If it were a real-world application--that is, if you went into the field of vision professionally--there are many more steps that may seem less difficult, but that turn out to be critical:This isn't to say university isn't the real world: just that you probably won't lose tens or hundreds of thousands of Euros/pounds/dollars if you happen to overlook something.You can see how to makes face recognition.But in your case, you can skip paragraph 3 and compare 2 with the reference image. Depending on the conditions, additional filtering may be necessary.","Since this is for a student project I'll emphasize image processing more than other aspects of an application.

Even if you weren't asked to do this specifically, this happens in production, and your professor may surprise you with it. At least have an idea how you would detect the presence of multiple rings.That's another aspect of vision: you may start thinking of what algorithms and lighting are necessary to solve ""the problem,"" but you'll also spend a lot of time figuring out everything that could go wrong, and writing software to detect those conditions to ensure you don't yield a false result. For example, what happens if the lights turn off? What if two rings are present? What if the ring isn't fully within the field of view? What if dirt gets on the surface the part is resting on? What if the lens gets dirty (which it will)?A few principles:
If it were a real-world application--that is, if you went into the field of vision professionally--there are many more steps that may seem less difficult, but that turn out to be critical:This isn't to say university isn't the real world: just that you probably won't lose tens or hundreds of thousands of Euros/pounds/dollars if you happen to overlook something.You can see how to makes face recognition.Face detection.Face alignment and normalization.Features extraction.Comparing features with pattern.But in your case, you can skip paragraph 3 and compare 2 with the reference image.

What is the size of CoAP packet?,"I'm new for this technology, can somebody help me to know about some doubt?
(I know there is 4 byte fixed header, but what is the maximum size limit including header, option and payload?)
(It works on UDP for how much time it keeps open the connection, is there any default time or it keeps open every time when we send packet?)
(Main problem with it CoAP is it works on UDP, is there any concept like MQTT QoS? Let's say a sensor publishes some data every one second, if subscriber goes offline, is there any surety in CoAP that subscriber will get all the data when it come online?)
(CoAP supports publish/subscribe architecture, may be it needs connection open all the time, is it possible with CoAP whether it is based on UDP.)
(I have one gateway and 5 sensors, how will these sensors connect to the gateway? Will the gateway find these sensors? Or will sensors find the gateway?)Please help me, I really need answer. I'm all new for these kind of things and suggest me something for implementation point of view.Thanks.","I never used MQTT, in any case CoAP is connectionless, requests and responses are exchanged asynchronously over UDP or DTLS. I suppose that you are looking for the observe functionality: it enables CoAP clients to ""subscribe"" to resources and servers to send updates to subscribed clients over a period of time.There is an  describing CoAP over TCP, but I don't know how it interacts with the observe functionality: usually It follows a , it just happens that the client is considered no longer interested in the resource and is removed by the server from the list of observers.The observe stops when the server thinks that the client is no longer interested in the resource or when the client ask to unsubscribe from the resource.There is a well-known relative URI ""/.well-known/core"". It is defined as a default entry point for requesting the list of links about resources hosted by a server.  for more infos.Look at 5."
IOT app development [closed],"I want to build an IoT mobile app(iOS/Android) that will mainly do the following:
user management(login/subscribe new user);add/configure new IoT device; interact with existing devices. Interact with IoT devices is the easiest part for me. What I'm struggling is the first 2 items. For this I was thinking to use a cloud platform like AWS( IOT(azure.microsoft.com) or WATSON IBM(). Reading the docs of them I could not see how to perform the first task or how to register a new device via a mobile app. Any comments are more than welcome.Also I was thinking building a database on a server that will manage the users, and sending/receiving messages from the IoT device/app as this app that I'm trying to build is not so data hungry(reading temperature and interacting with 2 relays)P.S. I know about Blynk.io but the prices/conditions that they are offering is exceeding my budget.You can use AWS IoT with Amazon Cognito Identity.

Synchronize Data From Multiple Data Sources,"Our team is trying to build a predictive maintenance system whose task is to look at a set of events and predict whether these events depict a set of known anomalies or not.We are at the design phase and the current system design is as follows:In order to classify a set of events as an anomaly, the events have to occur in the same time window. e.g. say there are three data sources pushing their respective events into Kafka topics, but due to some reason, the data is not synchronized.
So one of the inference engines pulls the latest entries from each of the kafka topics, but the corresponding events in the pulled data do not belong to the same time window (say 1 hour). That will result in invalid predictions due to out-of-sync data.We need to figure out how can we make sure that the data from all three sources are pushed in-order so that when an inference engine requests entries (say the last 100 entries) from multiple kakfa topics, the corresponding entries in each topic belong to the same time window?I would suggest , which is a streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka. It also provides nice functionality for Windowed Aggregation etc.There are 3 ways to define  in KSQL:In your context, you can use KSQL to query and aggregate the topics of interest using . For example,Some suggestions - Check this - Flink windows for reference how to choose right window type To handle this scenario, data sources must provide some mechanism for the consumer to realize that all relevant data has arrived. The simplest solution is to publish a batch from data source with a batch Id (Guid) of some form. Consumers can then wait until the next batch id shows up marking the end of the previous batch. This approach assumes sources will not skip a batch, otherwise they will get permanently mis-aligned. There is no algorithm to detect this but you might have some fields in the data that show discontinuity and allow you to realign the data.A weaker version of this approach is to either just wait x-seconds and assume all sources succeed in this much time or look at some form of time stamps (logical or wall clock) to detect that a source has moved on to the next time window implicitly showing completion of the last window. The following recommendations should maximize success of event synchronization for the anomaly detection problem using timeseries data.With these primitives, we should be able to align the timeseries events, accounting for time drifts due to network delays.At the inference engine side, expand your windows at a per producer level to synch up events across producers.","I would suggest , which is a streaming SQL engine that enables real-time data processing against Apache Kafka.

ESP8266 as a internet interface (access point),"I made some experiments with this amazing module.

Authenticate IoT Appliance Using Firebase Auth,"I can't figure out how to authenticate my IoT appliance to call Google Cloud App Engine APIs I've written using Firebase Auth.We currently do this with our browser app using Firebase Auth tokens.  We use the username and password to issue a token and then use that token during the life of the session to access APIs from our browser app.This doesn't translate well to our IoT appliance as there is no username/password - so we are thinking we will need to use Firebase custom tokens.  Unfortunately these tokens expire every hour - so we will need to use the Firebase Auth APIs to renew the tokens automatically - we think this is the way this works based on documentation.A constraint we have is that this appliance doesn't have any user experience but instead needs to be able to restart at any time and reestablish it's authenticity with the server by retrieving a fresh token.I'm having a hard time finding an example of how to do this - and I'm hoping someone can give me a simple example or some clear direction on how to keep a authentication token current while the appliance is on and establish a new one if it needs to restart.Thanks!Have you looked at Cloud IoT Core as an option? It handles the authentication piece for you without user/pass (uses JWT), and is designed for IoT.

Contiki UDP packet transmission duration with CC2538,"Could someone explain me what is going on within the Contiki-OS when it transmits an UDP packet?Here is the current consumption of my device in details running with the CC2538 chip:My question is: why it takes so long to transmit an UDP broadcast packet (about 250ms) knowing that theoretically at 250kbps the packet of 408 bits length should be transmitted in approximately 2ms? I'd understand if the transmission last lets say ten milliseconds but here the difference is huge. I use the example in  Does anyone have an idea? By default, Contiki uses ContikiMAC radio duty cycling (RDC) protocol. The protocol has to deal with two conflicting requirements: allow receiver nodes to sleep almost all of the time when there are no packets to receive, but at the same time allow to deliver data as reliably as possible. The solution adopted in ContikiMAC is to place the burden on the transmitter. Given that receiver checks the radio channel 8 times per second (the default configuration on cc2538dk platform), the transmitter has to transmit for at least 125 ms duration to be sure that the receiver has waken up and seen the packet. In practice, this means that a packet is retransmitted for multiple times in row. See the  and  for more detailed description.That being said, you won't always see transmissions with the maximum duration. If its an unicast, the receiver normally sends an ACK after successful reception. The transmitter checks for this ACK, and stops transmitting if received. This way, the expected average number of transmissions required is reduced two times. And then there's also  - it allows the sender to synchronize the start of transmission with the expected wakeup time of the receiver. But for broadcasts, no ACKs are generated and the phase optimization wont work.Another possible reason for unexpectedly long transmissions is a failing CCA check. Before transmitting a packet, the radio stack first checks if the medium is free; if it's not, it will back up for some time and retry.I found the problem : the radio is not turned off properly after the transmission of a packet. At the end of the function  in the file  the radio is turned off only if it was previously off. But actually the program never goes in this condition and the radio is not turned off immediately after the transmission of a packet.The problem arises because the function  (called at the beginning of the  function) clears this flag first. Thus the function  doesn't know anymore that the radio was off before its execution and therefore the radio is kept on.To fix the problem I put a local variable inside the  which turn off the radio and clear the flag only if it is turned on inside the function itself. The current consumption during a packet transmission looks like now to:: the strobe time was reduced intentionally to 10ms with:This explain why there is only three strobes of transmission for the broadcast message. The duration of a strobe is 3ms. Which means that the data rate is ~140kbps (?). ","By default, Contiki uses ContikiMAC radio duty cycling (RDC) protocol.

Encryption/Security strategy for IoT solution,"I am trying to figure out what encryption/security strategy to adopt for IoT based solution.
Here's my assessment. Has anyone come across a strategy wherein:Are my assumptions right ? Also it would be great if you can suggest me best practices for security in an IoT environment.Regards, ChaitannyaYour assessment is not entirely correct. There are also a number of IOT messaging systems provided by cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that contain some of the encryption strategies that might be useful to you.In regards to best practices, I am not recommending any particular vendor, however this link may be useful to show you how such a setup may operate:  ","Your assessment is not entirely correct. The assumption is not that the algorithm can be cracked, but that the algorithm and all input data other than the key is known to an attacker. In the case of AES, the standard is widely published, but this does not make it ineffective as it is designed so that the data cannot be easily decrypted without applying the key. AES128 and the other (higher) key sizes are considered secure enough to withstand modern day brute-force attacks.The wireless device, assuming you are using WPA/WPA2, will encrypt traffic over the air however that encryption ceases to apply once the packets have been received in the wireless access point. They will not be encrypted between the access point and their final destination. AES is a symmetrical key algorithm. There are two encryption strategies for you to consider. Encryption in transit between the source and the destination, and encryption at rest. It is unclear which of the two you are referring to, however each requires separate consideration and implementation. If you are referring to encryption in transit between servers, consider using an encrypted protocol such as HTTPS/SSL which is designed to encrypt data in transit using a variety of ciphers. AES is widely used as an appropriate cipher for encryption at rest, either at the file system level or using libraries to encode the data before storing in a database. In the case of HTTPS, it is strongly recommended that each client/server have its own private key. In the case of AES, again, each server should encrypt data at rest using it's own key.You are concerned about the possibility of packet capture and replay to control your server, however if you use a protocol similar to SSL, it will use a different key for each session to prevent pattern analysis via eavesdropping. If you are encrypting the data yourself to send, adding a simple time stamp or sequence number to the encoded data will ensure it has a vastly different encrypted output each time. For example  will result in completely different encrypted data to . AES also allows the use of what is known as an initialisation vector (IV) that, by using a random seed, will encode the same data into a completely different output each time. There are also a number of IOT messaging systems provided by cloud providers such as Microsoft and Amazon that contain some of the encryption strategies that might be useful to you.In regards to best practices, I am not recommending any particular vendor, however this link may be useful to show you how such a setup may operate:  "

why and when i need mqtt broker for IOT/M2M application,"Just asking one silly question, hope someone can answer this. I'm bit confused regarding MQTT broker. Basically, the confusion is, there are so many things being used for data storing, transfer and processing (like Flume, HDInsight, Spark etc). So, when and why I need to use one MQTT broker?If I would like to use Windows 10 IoT application with HiveMQ, from where can I get the details? how to use it? How I get benefit out of this MQTT broker? Can I not send data from my IoT application directly using Azure or HDFS? So, how MQTT broker fits into it or helping me to achieve something?I'm new to all these and tried to find some tutorials, however, I'm not getting anything proper. Please explain it in more details or give some tutorials for this?MQTT is a client-server protocol for pub-sub based transport that has a comparatively small overhead, and thus applicable to mobile and IoT applications (unlike Flume, etc.). The MQTT broker is basically a server that handles messaging to/from MQTT clients and among them. The functionality pretty much stops at the transport layer, even though various MQTT add-ons exist.If you are looking to implement a solution that would reliably transfer data from your IoT devices to the back-end system for processing, I would suggest you take a look into . It goes much further than MQTT by providing not only the transport layer, suitable for low-power IoT devices, but also a solid chunk of the application level logic (including the object bindings for your application-level data structures, temporary data persistence, etc.).Here is a link to a webinar that explains .This is an architectural choice. IoT applications are possible without MQTT but there are some advantages when using MQTT. If you are completely new to MQTT, take a look at this in-depth MQTT series: Basically the main architectural advantage is publish / subscribe designed for low-latency, high throughput (mobile) communication with minimal protocol overhead (which is important if bandwidth is at a premium). You can completely decouple consumers and producers. HDFS is the (distributed) Hadoop file system and is the foundation for Map / Reduce processing. It is not comparable to a MQTT broker. The MQTT broker could write to the HDFS, though (in case of HiveMQ with a custom plugin).Basically MQTT is a protocol while the products you are mentioning are, well, products which solve completely different problems:Flume is basically used for log aggregation at scale. You won't use MQTT for that, at least there is not too much advantage because this is typically done in backend applications.Spark and Hadoop shine at Big Data crunching. They are a framework and not a ready to use solution. They are not really comparable to MQTT. Often MQTT brokers like HiveMQ are used in conjunction with these, Spark / Hadoop for data processing and HiveMQ for communication.I hope this helps you getting started. Best would be to read about typical use cases of all these technologies, this is a bit too broad for a single SO answer.MQTT is a data transport, so the usual thing I have to compare it with is HTTP. HTTP has two important characteristics, a) It goes from one point to another, b) It is request/response, so only one end can start a data transfer. MQTT connects many end points to many end points, and either end can start a data transfer. So, if you have just one device and only one service or person that will ever access it, and only by polling, then HTTP is great. MQTT means many devices can post data to many services or people, AND the other way around. Your question assumes that your data is always going to land up in some sort of data store, but many interactions are about events and responding to them immediately, like ringing a doorbell, or lowering the landing gear. In these cases you will often want to both record the data, and have an immediate action occur, like your phone making a doorbell noise.Finally, you send data to MQTT semantically, rather than by IP address. 
This means that your services subscribes to /mikeshouse/doorbell rather than polling 192.168.22.4, which is a huge gain once you have a number of devices.","MQTT is a client-server protocol for pub-sub based transport that has a comparatively small overhead, and thus applicable to mobile and IoT applications (unlike Flume, etc.).

How to enforce the order of messages passed to an IoT device over MQTT via a cloud-based system (API design issue),"Suppose I have an IoT device which I'm about to control (lets say switch on/off) and monitor (e.g. collect temperature readings). It seems MQTT could be the right fit. I could publish messages to the device to control it and the device could publish messages to a broker to report temperature readings. So far so good.The problems start to occur when I try to design the API to control the device.Lets day the device subscribes to two topics:Then I publish messages to these topics in some order. But given the fact that messaging is typically an asynchronous process there are no guarantees on the order of messages received by the device.So in case two messages are published in the following order:they  be received in the reversed order leaving the device turned on, which can have dramatic consequences, depending on the context.Of course the API could be designed in some other way, for example there could be just one topicand the payload of individual messages would carry the meaning of an individual message (on/off). So in case messages are published to this topic in a given order they are expected to be received in the exact same order on the device.But what if the order of publishes to individual topics cannot be guaranteed? Suppose the following architecture of a system for IoT devices:The components of the system are:The important part is that as in most modern distributed systems the control service is a distributed, multi instance entity capable of processing multiple control messages from the application at a time. Therefore the order of messages published by the application can end up totally mixed when delivered to the IoT device.Now given the fact that most MQTT brokers only implement QoS0 and QoS1 but no QoS2 it gets even more interesting as such control messages could potentially be delivered multiple times (assuming QoS1 - see ).My point is that separate topics for control messages is a bad idea. The same goes for a single topic. In both cases there are no message delivery order guarantees.The only solution to this particular issue that comes to my mind is message versioning so that old (out-dated) messages could simply be skipped when delivered after another message with more recent version property.Most definitely.  The example you brought up is a generic control system, being attached to some message-oriented scheme.  There are a number of patterns that can be used when referring to a message-based architecture.   by Microsoft categorizes message patterns into two primary classes:The most generic pattern of command behavior is to issue a command, then measure the state of the system to verify the command was carried out.  If you forget to verify, your system has an open loop. Such open loops are (unfortunately) common in IT systems (because it's easy to forget), and often result in bugs and other bad behaviors such as the one described above.  So, the proper way to handle a command is:Events, on the other hand, are simply fired off. As the publisher of an event, it is not my business to worry about who receives the event, in what order, etc.  Now, it should also be pointed out that the use of any decent message broker (e.g. ) generally carries strong guarantees that messages will be delivered in the order which they were originally published.  So, if you treat a command as an event, your system is guaranteed to act up sooner or later.Message versioning typically refers to a property of the message class itself, rather than a particular instance of the class.  It is often used when multiple versions of a message-based API exist and must be backwards-compatible with one another.What you are instead referring to is unique message identifiers.  are particularly handy for making sure that each message gets its own unique id.  However, I would argue that de-duplication in message-based architectures is an anti-pattern. One of the consequences of using messaging is that duplicates are possible, so you should try to design your system behaviors to be stateless and . If this is not possible, it should be considered that messaging may not be the correct communication solution for the need.Using the command-event dichotomy as an example, you could perform the following transaction:In the event that the controller doesn't receive notification after some timeout, the controller can retry the command.  Note that ""light on"" is an idempotent command, in that multiple calls to it will have the same effect.When state changes, send the new state immediately and after that periodically every x seconds. With this solution your systems gets into desired state, after some time, even when it temporarily disconnects from the network (low battery).BTW: You did not miss anything.Apart from the comment that most brokers don't support QOS2 (I suspect you mean that a number of broker as a service offerings don't support QOS2, such as Amazon's AWS IoT service) you have covered most of the major points.If message order really is that important then you will have to include some form of ordering marker in the message payload, be this a counter or timestamp.","Most definitely.

Sending data from STM32F401 MCU to ESP8266 and getting response from ESP8266 to MCU,"I am working on an STM32f401 Nucleo board and ESP8266 wifi module.

I already tested the ESP module communication, I can connect TO THE wifi with AT commands through USB and can also receive data in web via socket connection.I configured USART1_TX/USART1_RX with PA9/PA10Thanks in advance.I'm not an expert, but I try to help you.Which baud rate are you using? Is it coherent with the ESP8266 documentation?Check the power supply and the connections.Therefore, remember that the AT commands are case sensitive (they must be written with capital letters only) and they must terminate with carriage return and line feed, so ""/r/n"".That's right at first check baud rate are  matching Then do you use dma  for both tx/rx direction ? 
For dma rx note that the ""completion"" callback will be called only when the full buffer will be filled. 
If you neeed to ""break"" reception on ending  ""\n"" ""\n"" then you might use the interrupt rx method oen hatr at a time and inspect it as it arrives in the callback that keep on asking one more byte until not done.

About Jasper IoT Platform,"I am just bit curious. I am new in IoT and currently started working on it using ESP8266 device. I know that it needs some firmware to write and install, like smart.js.But I have read, Jasper () can connect any device and manager, monitor etc. So I am bit curious how it works internally. I am not sure whether it installs firmware created by Jasper or in other way. I was reading this article: Anyone knows about this? I mean how Jasper works to connect to any devices?Cisco bought Jasper, which is useful for IoT business. However it might be better way for you to check Interactor() which is great for IoT development. Interactor works to conntect to any device with any protocol. Cisco Jasper should not be confused with device management libraries (whether they be server based, or device based or both).Jasper is a telecom based service that allows you to see and manage the connection state of sim inserted in the device. Regardless of the state of a device, the modem and sim (provided they are powered) will connect to the telco and provide basic information about the connection.Think of it as a network tool (server originated) for the gateway on the device, not the device itself. It allows you to force disconnect devices from the network, ban sims from the account so a stolen or runaway sim can eat through data, basic connectivity tests (is the modem powered, does the sim have permission to transmit data over the network, etc).The main value of jasper is that it allows you to manage you data costs by applying the appropriate rate plan to each device, and disconnect devices that are using too much (for whatever reason).Jasper does not cost anything to use, however telcos will apply a rev commit (min monthly spend) usually $500/month to gain access. the sims are the same as PCS (phone) sims, but they are on their own network internally, and are specific to that telcos jasper. i.e. you can't take 500 devices using PCS sims, and import those sims into jasper. you'd need to do a physical swap of the sims.","Cisco bought Jasper, which is useful for IoT business.

Another issue is the rate at which you're updating your documents. Bottom line recommendation is that if you are only updating the document once per ~minute or less frequently, then it could be reasonable for your application to update a single document. That is, you'd add new key-value pairs to the same document with the same  value. In order to do that, however, you'll need to GET the full doc, add the new key-value pair, and then PUT that document back to the database. You must make sure that your are providing the most recent  of that document and you should also check for conflicts that could occur if the document is being updated by multiple devices.

How to do Software deployment for IoT devices (Linux based)? [closed],"A client that I’m working for has a fleet of BeagleBones/Raspberry PI’s operating at customer locations. These devices are installed on local networks and behind firewalls. For SSH connectivity there are several options but we’re still struggling with Software deployments on these devices. We’re not relying on container technology for the moment, so Docker Cloud or Resin.io are not an option, but resin.io looks very promising. We’re using AWS IoT for data collection.Some requirements regarding the deployment:What are some good approaches to achieve this?The good thing is, that software that does not rely on containers, can still packaged up (while it does not work the other way around). Containers in resin.io are used as a means to deliver software onto the device, and implement interesting, useful, and safe update strategies, which otherwise would not be possible or would be harder to do. For example:This is not to convince you about container tech, just highlighting that whether or not your own application is containerized (most likely it's not and will stay like that!), do not select against services that use that tech as part of their stack. Every service tries to deliver the functionality you need in any ways necessary.As for your checklist with regards to :Also, you mentioned AWS IoT, there's  on integrating resin.io with AWS, including an example project doing automatic device provisioning of resin.io devices with AWS IoT (plug in a device, and it automatically gets credentials for AWS IoT). It might be something that interests you.How about Kura project?

How to create Android Things' bundle and push it over OTA?,"Anyone succeeded creating Android Things Bundle and pushing it over OTA?On the Android Things' Console, there's a page to  for the OTA.I'm trying to figure out how to do that. I've adding just a single APK file  to a  file. Then I've tried to push it to a RPi which is sitting nearby. But the main.apk would not be launched on the device.Things I've tried/done:But I couldn't make an OTA update. Anyone succeeded doing so?Here's my project on Github:
ThanksHere are all the steps necessary to make OTA update possible after creating a new product in your android things console :1 - Create your first build configuration, either from the empty bundle in the console or from a personnal bundle you added.2 - Download build of this build configuration. You will get an Android Things image. Flash it to your RPi as you did when you flashed the Android Things regular image. From now on, your RPi will check if a different version of your product has been pushed from the console. The check happens every 5 or 6 hours so you might have to be patient. Also your RPi needs to have internet access.3 - Upload another bundle to your console, create a build configuration for it and then push it to your devices via the OTA updates panel of your console.4 - You will need to manually reboot the RPi to apply the update.This article from Dave McKelvie is a good example in my opinion : I had a problem with getting the main apk to run. Turns out if your custom animation is misconfigured the main apk will fail to load and it will never be launched. I solved the problem by installing a stock build with empty bundle. Using adb to connect and retrieve the existing animation. I then used this animation along with my main apk to create a bundle. I loaded this image on my device and my main app loaded just fine.","Here are all the steps necessary to make OTA update possible after creating a new product in your android things console :1 - Create your first build configuration, either from the empty bundle in the console or from a personnal bundle you added.2 - Download build of this build configuration.

Memory usage on MQTT subscription,"How much of memory used whenever we use from  to subscription into many topics? for example if we have over , it's possible to use  to subscribe into all of them, or it caused to memory leaks?This problem is strictly related to the MQTT broker and client implementation. 
Of course, the MQTT standard specification doesn't provide any information on the features related to such implementation.Paolo.Extending on ppatierno's answer.For most well designed brokers the number or scope (for wild card) subscriptions shouldn't really change the amount of memory used under normal circumstances . At most the storage should equate to the topic string that the client subscribes to, this will be matched against a incoming message to see if it should be delivered.Where this may not hold true is with persistent subscriptions (where the clean session value is not set to true). In this case if a client disconnects then messages may be queued until it reconnects. The amount of memory consumed here will be a function of the number of messages and their size (plus what discard policy the broker may have) and not directly a function of the number of subscribed topics.To answer the second part of your question, subscribing to 10,000,000 topics using the wildcard is not likely to cause a memory leak, but it may very well flood the client depending on how often messages are published on those topics.","This problem is strictly related to the MQTT broker and client implementation.

Discover raspberry's IP,"I have a Raspberry with win 10 IoT, working as a main server for a cloud of sensors. In the raspberry I have a server that broadcast its IP using UDP broadcast.

What is the best way to store sensor data in Clickhouse?,"We have a set of devices and all of them have sensors. All devices have some common set of sensors, but some devices have additional sensors. Every sensor has different discretization level and some sensors could change sometimes very fast, and sometimes could not change for some time. 
For example, we have DeviceA and have a stream of packets in a form(NULL means that value doesn't change):And DeviceB:After some time new sensors could be added to some device.
Every sensor could be any of numeric types(Int32, UInt8, Float32)After that data will be used to calculate: dau, mau, retention, GPS coordinates clustering and so on.We could simply create some table:But two problems here: no support for a different set of sensors and sometimes we have null values for some sensor values in case of no changes and it would be great to see last non null value before a timestamp.The first problem we could solve by creating a table with fields: SensorName, Timestamp, Date, Value. But how to choose correct type? Should we use different tables for different types? 
Probably we need to use graphite engine, unfortunately, I have no any experience with that. So any help is really appreciated. It would be great to have possibility to keep only changed values of any sensor.I found a way how to deal with null values. We could use ""anyLast"" function to request last received value for a column:Unfortunately we can't fill all missing values using some kind of overlapping window functions(no support for them in clickhouse). So in case of nullable field aggregate function will use only not null values and in case of non-nullable field all values including zero values will be used and both ways are incorrect. A workaround is to fill null values before insert using select with anyLast values for all null values in a row. You can use Clickhouse like a time-series database.Your table definition is restricting you from having dynamic metrics. That's why you are trying to deal with NULL values.You can use this table for sensor values:Here we are loading sensor values of device A:Querying deviceA temp data:Check  to get a detailed usage.",You can use Clickhouse like a time-series database.Your table definition is restricting you from having dynamic metrics.

Does PTC ThingWorx platform support java enterprise application and database porting?,"Just wanted to know whether IOT based ThingWorx platform supports in-production Java application and database porting. I had already worked on Google App Engine and it supports database(with data dump) porting available for selected DB.What all needs to be done if I am having Java rest api based project and port it to ThingWorx platform to utilize M2M communication. I couldn't get a complete context about support java EE application. But upto my understanding, yes ThingWorx platfrom supports Java EE application (it was built using Java, Javascript and webservices). In the , you can import/export the database. To import the data, you need  file and to import entities, you need  file. Thingworx also supports connecting to Relational DB like Postgresql, MS SQL etc., Taking a DB dump is possible. Thingworx is a powerful M2M communication platform. It has its own builders - Composer (data modelling) and Mashup (UI) plus data storage and connectivity options and many more IoT capabilities.
It also supports connecting to external DB and Java extensions for writing custom functionalities.
I believe, enterprise application and database porting(DB dump) are not yet supported. Thingworx application can be connected to existing external DB.For more details:
ThingWorx does not have any inherent database porting methods available, however, it is not be terribly hard to write you own - I've done this and assisted with this for several migrations when the database backend was changing and data was still pouring into the old server while we brought the new one online. ThingWorx provides JDBC Connectors, a SQL connector, so you could easily read the database rows out and write into ThingWorx. Or write RESTful services to talk from Twx server A to Twx server B. Less easy, I suppose, if you have tons and tons of both meta data and actual rows of data.If you are serious about Thingworx, you are likely running at least two servers, the Platform server and a database server. (These should not be the same box.) In this case you have more porting options (like pg_dump if you are on Postgres, or similar dump tool if you are on DataStax or SAP) to another database. If you are using AWS or another cloud database you can take an image of the database and spin up a new one. This is often easier than exporting entities and data, esp once you have a lot of both.As for application porting... there is not really a good way to do this. ThingWorx mostly runs on JavaScript based scripts. You can develop extension packages and that is all done Java, but you would have to do that yourself and mush you original Java it into the ThingWorx extension package format, or at least wrap it with their Entities. That is not where ThingWorx shines as a development platform - it's a great platform overall but not for that, yet.","I couldn't get a complete context about support java EE application.

raspberry-pi - sensor details with Raspberry pi?,"Is it, in any way, possible to get a sensor details (e.g. manufacturer, type, model, function, etc.) using a raspberry pi?
Thanks.No it is not possible i guess. Because for getting information, that sensor details should be in the consideration of raspberry pi developers. you have to take a look into sensor datasheetIt is possible if the sensor manufacturer has incorporated such functionality which allows the sensor to communicate its stored data via any communication protocol.  Each DS18B20 has a unique 64-bit serial code, which allows multiple DS18B20s to function on the same 1-Wire bus. The address is stored in the IC, therefore you have communicate and extract the address.I have only tried this using C++. I looked up the web for .So yeah, it depends on sensor rather then functionality of controller. What kind of sensor are you talking about? Temperature sensor, IR sensor? What is the communication between the sensor and the raspberry pi? Is it via I2C or just an Analog read? If the communication is done with more sophisticated communication such as Bluetooth or Wifi and has a protocol, then it may be able to query those sensor detailsNope, Typically what the Rasberry PI sees the sensor is just a raw analog signal or a digital signal of the data.

How to create customized Dashboards of streaming data in Microsoft Azure IoT?,"I have created an Event Hub in the Azure portal.

Raspberry Pi and RF module MX-RM-5V power through gpio and noise?,"i have a tiny RF 433mHz project with my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B v1.2 and Arduino Pro mini.My Raspberry works as a receiver and Pro mini as a transmitter.I have wiried the popular RF receiver MX-RM-5V to my RPi's GPIO.Receiver and transmitter modules have coiled antennas.I used the GPIO 5V pin to supply my receiver and logic level converter. I'm using logic level converter because the receiver works with 5V and GPIO with 3.3V  logic.  Raspberry has micro usb 2A adapter.
The MX-RM-5V uses 11.50 mA. Is there some component on the raspberry's 5V rail between micro-usb and gpio 5v pin that limits the current ?How much noise the Raspberry generates on its rails and what kind ? Can this be the problem ?Update:i measured 1kHz constant noise with oscillator from MX-RM-5V module when it is connected to the raspberry pi 3. With external power supply the module works ok. When the module received something the noise dropped to 300-400 Hz.I found a visual solution and rather simple way from youtube to really see the noise on the data pin. When i connected green LED with a 100 Ohm resistor to the data pin the led is constantly glowing. Its not bright but you see small green light. On this occasion the receiver did not receive nothing. So is was pure constant noise.Next step was to start messing with . I connected 240Ohm resistor and 1.5 uF cap as low pass between data pin and ground. So i connected the greed LED to filtered voltage and the constant noise were filtered. Led is blinking by the data signals only when the transmitter sends something to the receiver.Also, my  in the transmitter and receiver code was a bit high. I moved from 1000 bits/s down to 200 bits/s.From now, the raspberry can detect data from this module and everything is a lot better.","Update:i measured 1kHz constant noise with oscillator from MX-RM-5V module when it is connected to the raspberry pi 3.

Alexa (Smart Home Skill) to determine if device is offline.,"I had created a simple Smart Home Skill for Alexa and I had successfully connected the skill to my device using AWS IoT but I can't figure out how I can make Alexa determine whether the device is offline or online. For example if I ​ask alexa to turn on the device, and if the the power of the device is off or the device is disconnected from the internet, I want Alexa to say the device is not responding. I can't think of a way, could anyone help?If you are developing a Smart Home skill then the responses that Alexa says are built into the Alexa service. So if you send back an ""ENDPOINT_UNREACHABLE"" response she is going to say ""xxx is not responding"" which is the built in response for that error type. If on the other hand your'e building a Custom skill then the responses are entirely up to you.

Bluetooth LE C# Advertising and Scan Interval,"I have recently started developing UWP projects and have been trying to establish a connection with a  BLE device, which, according to its documentation, has three primary services running.The documentation does not point out such a way, but I have found a possibility to read the device data (frameType, productModel, batteryLevel, temperature, humidity, MAC address) during the BLE scan, because the device responds (?) to these scans with an undocumented service (UUID: 0000ffe1-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb) and a corresponding serviceData string.I have created a simple BluetoothLEAdvertisementWatcher object and subscribed to its Received events. This way I get only one serviceData string from this object during runtime. The code snippet is below: The above code successfully prints the required data using the S1Sensor helper class method that I wrote. The only problem is that the device's advertising interval, by default, is set to 1000 ms, but I only receive this string once (rarely twice) during application run. Is there a way to receive and process these serviceData more frequently? (preferrably every 1000 ms)
My other problem is that this code only returns values when the device is paired to my computer. I think I should be able to scan for devices without connecting and see their response (serviceData) even when the device is not paired to the computer.
Is there a way to query the serviceData string even when the computer that is running this application not paired to the device?Thank you for your time.If the device is in connection state instead of advertising state, it will not advertise and can cause you can't receive serviceData anymore. You need to disconnect your device in order to put it back in advertising state.

How should subscription topic be be organized in mqtt broker?,"I am creating my own implementation of mqtt broker (I know there are few existing, but I need realy tiny one - for embeded project). I wonder how sholud  topic be organised - should I store topic list and connect clients IDs for  particular topic or should every client instance has its own list of subscribed topic? What is better aproach?I would say it would be better to go for storing clients and fetching the ones with matching topic when a message is received.This will help incase you are using the # wildcard. Also If you store topics and attach clients to them, then you will have to go to multiple topics each with multiple clients for every message you receive.But if you store the clients and link the topic to them, you will have to iterate through the list of clients and then go for 1 topic each. I see that as one less for loop.","I would say it would be better to go for storing clients and fetching the ones with matching topic when a message is received.This will help incase you are using the # wildcard.

I posted a question here on SO regarding this as well, with more details and link to example code I had to use for handling this:
The AWS IoT platform publishes messages on a special MQTT topic (prefixed with ) when your device connects/disconnects. You can easily use these to monitor these events - however, you should be aware that the MQTT protocol is designed to be robust to a poor networking conditions and the broker on the AWS side probably doesn't think it's a bit deal to disconnect a client. The broker expects that the client will just reconnect and queue messages for a moment during that process (which can be a big deal on a microcontroller).All that being said, the AWS topics you would watch are:andand the documentation for these (and other) lifecycle events are located:  "
is there a way to virtualize IOT devices on virtual machines,"Is it possible to install a virtual machine on the openstack cloud? Let's say I want to simulate a gps device inside of a virtual machine, I looked a little bit and i found out that i can do it using the command ""gpsfake"" ( at least this is start but i'm not sure that is really what i'm looking for), i want another iot device virtualized in another virtual machine to constantly get the coordinates from the first VM and then I'll program it to do an action of my choosing later on depending on the coordinates.I guess you have to do it the other way round because openstack is really a cloud os that you might install on a virtual machine and not the other way round. Basically the shortest routes are :1) Install virtualbox on your laptop2) create a virtual machine (ubuntu or centos)2) install openstack on the virtual machine .Follow either route depending on your choice of VM OS
  A) for centos 
  B) for ubuntu 3) create  instances inside the openstack ( actually virtual machines)4) Deploy your app inside the instances","I guess you have to do it the other way round because openstack is really a cloud os that you might install on a virtual machine and not the other way round.

TI iBeacon configuration,"Hello I've got some iBeacons, but I don't know anything about manufacturer, I need anyway to configure that beacons with custom UUID, Major and  Minor parameters. So after search around I've understand that the chip inside is an CC2541 - HMSensor. As I understand well it's produced by Texas Instruments, but unfortunately any app I've tried (Even SensorTag both on iOS and Android) to edit iBeacon tags failed, no one seems to be able to allow me change UUID, Major and Minor.I hope that someone could help me to understand better in which situation I am. Phisically the beacon is just the CC2541 board () with a module to attach a button battery.It sounds like you don't know what firmware is installed on the CC2541.  If your device does have base firmware, you'd need a  CP2102 USB to Serial Converter as described in the link you have in the question, then you'd need to wire it up to your CC2541 and then you'd need a serial cable to connect it to your computer.  From that point you may be able to use a terminal program to set the identifiers if the CC2541 has base firmware.  If your CC2541 does not have base firmware, you'll need an additional  jig that allows you to flash new firmware so you can get the identifiers configured.If you are just using these devices because they are convenient, it would be far easier to order new off-the-shelf beacons that are configurable.  If you actually do want to learn to use this hardware, I'd suggest getting a development setup going through tutorials like you have linked above.","It sounds like you don't know what firmware is installed on the CC2541.

Questions on Bluemix IOT Driver Behavior service,"Came across the interesting service (Experimental) on Bluemix - Driver Behavior. Curious to know how it actually works, how does the data get to Bluemix from the car and is there a need to have an external app/device in the car to collect and post data to Bluemix something similar to Aviva's Rate my Drive app?One simple example is to use  and  to receive car probe data via MQTT and send the received data into  service in the  workflow.

Minimum requirements Azure IoT Hub,"Does someone know the bare minimum required for a device to connect to the Azure IoT Hub and to send and receive messages (in terms of memory usage, processing power etc.).

OPC UA information model,"Lets say I have multiple distributed complex machines. Each machine contains of multiple cpmplex devices. Each device has its own OPC UA server to monitore the device components. With an OPC UA client I want to read all the data items of the OPC UA servers. Now I don't know how to build the information model. I design a global information model which contains all machines, their devices and the internal components of the devices. From the global point of view, that makes sense. But do I have to create also a local information model for each server? Or does the local OPC UA server use the global information model, but the server implements only for that server relevant objects (based on the global information model)?Here is an example setup: In the example you can see three layers - machine layer, building layer and factory layer. Here is my understanding how to model such setups. There is one overall OPC UA information model, which describes all types etc. Each OPC UA server knows that information model and all contained type descriptions. Now, depending on the real world setup, I can create an object model. An OPC UA server at the machine layer contains all objects from the underlying system, in this example the devices. With an OPC UA Client at the building layer, I can connect to the OPC UA server from the machines and I can read all data items from the devices inside the machines. An OPC UA client at the factory layer can connect to the OPC UA servers from the buildings. The OPC UA server at the building level can provide more objects:And an OPC UA client from outside the factory can see the whole picture of the object model: But how can I route through the servers to get the device data from outside the factory? Do I have to create the object model from the machine layer again in the building layer? And again in the next higher level layer and so on? Or does any OPC UA server at each layer know the whole object model like the information model? The OPC UA servers include two main categories of information: types and instances.When we are talking about information models, we typically talk about different type definitions. For example generic models for all devices (OPC UA for Device (DI)) or specific models for certain device types (OPC UA for Analyzer Devices (ADI), etc). The types define common structures for objects: when you encounter an object of type ""spectrometer"", for example, you know what kind of structure to expect from it. The types are often fixed and when they are standardised, they should not change. If you define your own types, which can be specialisations of the standard types, you have of course a bit more flexibility.Now, if you wish to model a complete production site, you would be creating the outline and arrangement of actual instances: ""Spectrometer 1"" inside the ""Laboratory"" and ""Vessel 13"" inside the ""ProductionHall B"", for example. This model is typically more dynamic and up to change, when the layout of the facility is changed. Due to the above reasons, we don't typically model the instances in the standard models or talk about them that much as information models. You could think that they are more or less the configuration of the system.Now, as you've realised, the whole system may consist of various OPC UA servers in practice. The capabilities of each server are varying and your options may be limited. In an ideal world, all servers would be serving data modelled via proper information models. That is, the instances would follow the structures of standard types or enabling you to model them with your own types. On the other hand, most of the currently existing OPC UA servers are just providing ""unmodeled"" data. This was the only option in OPC Classic and most actual OPC UA servers are still on the same level. Hopefully, in future we will see more OPC UA servers providing the option to adopt information models in them as well. Or we might see a rise of ""Aggerating OPC UA Servers"", which enable you to remodel the data according to standard or custom models.Anyway, when you create models of your systems, I advice you to concentrate on the type information and then just apply this to the actual layout model of your system by using these types.To actually answer your question, I think it is enough if you just create the model you need in your system, since you cannot probably spread it very well to the actual OPC UA servers at the moment. But of course, it would be better if you could apply the models to the specific servers as well.The system could be modelled using three different models, and links among the three models:The following tasks are required:","The OPC UA servers include two main categories of information: types and instances.When we are talking about information models, we typically talk about different type definitions.

Get data range by date from Thingspeak Channels api,"I have logged tens of thousands of values in Thingspeak for a couple of months. When retrieving the data with the Channels api I can set the start parameter. If I set it to yesterday I will get everything after that (as long as the value count is below 8000, which is the maximum amount that can be retrieved in one request). If I set it to two months ago (after which about 20000 values have been logged) I will get the most recent 8000 values.So now when I set start date (end date is implicitly set to now) I get the big X from the first row as in the example above when I want the values on the second row.How would I get 8000 values from the moment I specify?Is there any other way or do I actually need to set both start and end date and put an interval that is smaller than the time I can log 8000 values and then make more queries to the api to fill up my requested values?I believe both start and end date are required.

Try adding it both in  and Android Volley POST request set Content-Type to value ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" by default. If you set content type in your request call it will override your content type.
For example if your send request ""Content-Type"", ""application/json"" then it will set the content type to ""application/json"". But if you remove it then automatically it set to ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"". Problem here is if your back end configured(written by the developers) only to manage ""application/json"" request then the default call ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" would fail your request.(Problem with the back end development). But this will work fine in the POSTMAN. So can't figure out what is actually wrong here. Since you can send a post request by setting ""Content-Type"" to ""application/json"" then depend on Volley version your call will fail. Only Volley version 1.1.1 will support override.

Try adding it both in  and Android Volley POST request set Content-Type to value ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" by default. If you set content type in your request call it will override your content type.
For example if your send request ""Content-Type"", ""application/json"" then it will set the content type to ""application/json"". But if you remove it then automatically it set to ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"". Problem here is if your back end configured(written by the developers) only to manage ""application/json"" request then the default call ""application/json; charset=UTF-8"" would fail your request.(Problem with the back end development). But this will work fine in the POSTMAN. So can't figure out what is actually wrong here. Since you can send a post request by setting ""Content-Type"" to ""application/json"" then depend on Volley version your call will fail. Only Volley version 1.1.1 will support override.

mqtt.js | client.connected returns false though client seems to be connected,"while playing around with mqtt.js of node.js i figured out that the value of client.connected seem to be wrong or i misunderstand something. 
I did this tutorial  and everything works fine. 
I tried to get more into mqtt, so i looked up on  , Description of client.connected:In order to look if it works, i modified the sourcecode for the firstline just like thisI just added the if-clause. When executing the script, I always receive the message, that something went wrong, ergo: connected --> false. 
But why?The problem is that the  call is asynchronous. So it returns before it has actually connected. This means as you test the  straight after calling  it will still be false because it's not actually finished connecting yet.You need to register event handlers to be told when the client has actually been connected.This code connects to a broker, subscribes to the topic  then publishes a message to that same topic. When it receives a message on the  topic it prints it out then exits.","The problem is that the  call is asynchronous. So it returns before it has actually connected.

"SIM7000 ""Normal Power Down"" with AT+SMCONN or AT+SMDISC command","I'm making a project with a SIM7000A in Argentina, a tracker device for bee hives. It work over LTE Cat-M technology for IoT devices. I make a MQTT connection with a broker, everything is working. But sometimes happen a different behavior.When the microcontroller send AT+SMCONN or AT+SMDISC via series, the SIM7000A responses is ""OK"" normally, or ""ERROR: operation not allowed"", if something is wrong. Both are ok. But sometimes, the response is """" or """". So, the SIM7000A is power off obviously. If i run the turn on rutine, it work ok.I have done several tests, with Litio battery (5000mAh full charged), then a 12 V 30 A source. The SIMCOM chip work over a Shield + Arduino UNO, where is applyed the source. The voltage over chip is ok and there is not current limit.
The stranger thing is it doesn't happen all the time, and it's not suddlenly power off, it's a NORMAL POWER DOWN, as if I will sent AT+CPOWD=1\r\n.Sometimes it work for some minutes and then the rare behavior happen, almost always when I make a signal loss simulation with a faraday cage, but it happen sometimes with good signal level.I attach an example of the sequence. After executing the same routine successfully (without shutting down) several times:I await your prompt response, thank you very much in advance.

How to run an object whose functions can be called as threads,"I'm writing a script for a Raspberry Pi in Python whose purpose is to listen to a server/message broker for commands and execute said commands with certain hardware.  Sometimes, those commands must last for a specified duration (i.e. I need something to turn on, stay on for t seconds, then turn off) and this is accomplished by having the code sleep for said duration between on and off commands (this happens inside a function call -- hardware1.on(dur = t)).  I would like to be able to interrupt that sequence with another command (such as turning the hardware off before t seconds is up).  I've tried to accomplish this via multiprocessing,  but cannot get the behavior I'm looking for.This hardware (a stalk of differently colored lights) is controlled via a class, LiteStalk.  This class is made up of Lite objects (each light in the stalk), which have their own class too.  Both classes inherit multiprocessing.process.  In my main code that creates a specific LiteStalk and then listens to a message broker (MQTT-based) for commands, I evaluate the commands published to the broker (this is in the on_message callback which runs when a message is published to the broker).class Lite(multiprocessing.Process):class LiteStalk(multiprocessing.Process):The command always runs to its completion before being executing whatever other commands were published to the server, i.e. the stalk stays on for the commanded duration, and cannot be commanded to turn off (or anything else) before the duration is up.  I think this may be becuase I am not including all the functionality of my multiprocessing-able objects in a run() function, but I've messed around with that with no luck.The Paho MQTT client is single threaded (the thread you start with the  function) it can only call  for one message at a time.This means it will block in the call to  until whatever was passed to it has finished, even if that is code is creating new threads to do things.I was going to suggest replacing sleep with waiting with a timeout on a threading.Event or the equivalent and then checking when the sleep ends if it was due to the event being set or the timeout. If the event was set, stop.But it seems there are other issues than just an interrupt-able sleep.","The Paho MQTT client is single threaded (the thread you start with the  function) it can only call  for one message at a time.This means it will block in the call to  until whatever was passed to it has finished, even if that is code is creating new threads to do things.I was going to suggest replacing sleep with waiting with a timeout on a threading.Event or the equivalent and then checking when the sleep ends if it was due to the event being set or the timeout.

Which machine learning algorithm should i use to predict if particular parking space will be occupied?,"I'm working on my idea for Master thesis topic.

What is major difference when we want to build IoT solution if we use middleware or libraries or custom development?,"What is major difference when we want to build IoT solution if we use middleware or libraries or custom development?Let's imagine that there are so many street lights, camera for illegal parking or some sensors and we should build some solution to integrate. What I found is that they are using different protocol(tcp, serial) and data type(binary, xml, text). Colleague recommend some way like middleware or libraries but I doubt if it is efficient for maintenance or not.  Middleware is strong tool for IoT solution which provides connection between different layers. It is easy to use, but there might be multiple adjustments needed for matching middleware requirements.You can use library as a joint. If you have suitable library, you can easily connect using minimum extra programming. You might have to use multiple libraries, and additional libraries could be needed when new, unsupported components are added.Custom development is a traditional way. It is time-consuming job, but If you code everthing, you don't need any other help.I heard declarative backend software like Interactor might be another solution. You can construct connections and make your own logic with smaller resources.","Middleware is strong tool for IoT solution which provides connection between different layers.

See below:Please help.Here is what solved the problem:Elsewhere on the internet they suggested that you put a resistor inbetween the echo and the pin on the NodeMCU board (ESP8266), This made the measurements trip out pretty badly. So right now I have it working 100% with 5v and Ground (to the HC-SR04) connected to my RPi GPIO, and the trigger and echo connected to the NodeMCU board pins. Another thing to note is that I was doing readings at 1s, (last line of the code), changing that to 2 seconds made the code a lot more accurate.Hope this helps someone.Here's the diagram:Take a look at  to get it easier to work with HC-SR04 Sensor driver in micropython.","Here is what solved the problem:Elsewhere on the internet they suggested that you put a resistor inbetween the echo and the pin on the NodeMCU board (ESP8266), This made the measurements trip out pretty badly.

Android Things and Bluetooth Gatt Client (Central),"I've not done a lot of Android development and at best I'm a n00b!I'm looking at using ""Android Things"" on a RPi3 to connect to a sensor tag via BTLE. The tag is already configured and holds some data, it's running as a GATT Server and is the peripheral. I have a Advertising service UUID I can scan for and connect to then read the characteristics once a bond is in place.I would like to use the RPi running Android Things O/S to scan for the sensor tag, then connect and read the data from the sensor tag as it passes by. In a similar fashion to a mobile application.When the sensor passes by for the first time, the user will be required to authorise the connection on the sensor tag by pressing a button. This should create a bond.I can't see any examples if this scenario is possible or not. Typically, the use case is round the other way and the examples are of Android Things (RPi) running a GATT Server advertising it's services to a GATT Client.I've been having a look at the documentation here, but not sure how this would work:
The example here seems to be the opposite of what I'm looking for with the GATT server running on the Android Things end:
We did not produce a GATT client sample specific to Android Things because the existing Android samples already covered this case pretty well. You can use the standard Android BLE APIs without any changes, so have a look at the existing .Additionally, if you find it helpful, I personally built an Android  a few years back that talks specifically to the SensorTag. It was a previous version of the hardware, but the overall concepts should remain the same.","We did not produce a GATT client sample specific to Android Things because the existing Android samples already covered this case pretty well.

MQTT for large architectures,"I am looking to implement MQTT architecture for a building. Around 1000+ nodes are communicating and interchanging data with broker.

BTW, we are using ESP8266 chip at node side.This sort of question is impossible to answer without knowing way more about the situation you intend to deploy.MQTT is a protocol not a solution, the size of the deployment entirely depends on the following:1000's of clients is nothing compared to some of the deployments from IBM/Amazon/Microsoft.Your best bet is to build a test rig and test it to see how much resources your specific scenario uses.","This sort of question is impossible to answer without knowing way more about the situation you intend to deploy.MQTT is a protocol not a solution, the size of the deployment entirely depends on the following:1000's of clients is nothing compared to some of the deployments from IBM/Amazon/Microsoft.Your best bet is to build a test rig and test it to see how much resources your specific scenario uses."

Californium CoAP path parameters,"I'm working on a CoAP application using Eclipse Californium and I need to pass parameters using the URL as we do in restful web services. Is it possible to do it in californium coap implementation, and if so please let me know how to do it.
ex:The short answer is yes you can do it.As stated in JavaDocsSo basically you have to override  and maybe  methods in  in order to return appropriate resource which will handle the request. Also it will be required to analyse Exchange Request UriPath as a part of resource handleGET/PUT/POST/etc to fetch path variable (this can be done by using )Based on the source code of Californium it should be pretty easy to override the default behaviour of a request deliverer.Good luck with that!From what I have seen so far, creating a custom  seems to be the more complicated solution. Actually it looks like the correct solution is to override  so it returns the resource you want to be associated with that name. The  looks to me more like the way to implement some sort of controller that delivers or distribute requests in a more complicated environment.For the question where the last part of the URI is the parameter, the solution could look like this:Regarding the the answer from @Copernic, I personally think it does not match the idea of REST. Each part of the URI path should return its own resource related to its parent, which makes it a tree structure per definition and not a flat list that simply inspects parts of the path as some sort of parameter.IMHO even the sensors example could be resolved by using  implementations where the variable child resource could be dynamically resolved. The snippet below is just an example, of course this would need to be dependent on the real situation where a house and its rooms would need to register somehow.In that example the resources are dynamically created if they did not exist before. This could be also exchanged with some lookup or register mechanism (e.g. a house is registered via PUT or PUSH).Don't misunderstand me here. The solution by @Copernic seems to work and is probably a suitable solution for some scenarios (e.g. each house has its own server and the requests need to be redirected), but for a rather simple scenario it looks to me that it is not the correct way to go.You can override  as stated by Alex, However my approach is that I don't pre-register the resources tree, I register resource by resource without maintaining a hierarchy.Full answer code with steps is here : ","The short answer is yes you can do it.As stated in JavaDocsSo basically you have to override  and maybe  methods in  in order to return appropriate resource which will handle the request.

Getting Data from Kaa server without using Log Apender,"I am using Kaa client to pump data to Kaa server. 
I want to fetch this data in order to showcase on a client application. With the use of Log Appenders, I am able to do so.

However, when I tried to access Mysql (which is part of Kaa Sandbox), I was unable to do so.
Can anyone tell how can we do this?Yes, Kaa should be configured to append the gathered telemetry to some Log Appender (one can also create a Customer Log Appender with specific functionality if required) or even a set of Log Appenders - depending on the use case.The easiest way is to configure one of the existing Log Appenders to log the data to e.g. Cassandra and then retrieve the data from there.Should you need real time triggering of some actions depending on the data received from client(s), you would probably need to try developing a Custom Log Appender for that.We need to have a external Log appender in order to log the data.

Any help is really appreciated!If there is no documented API you can, in theory,  to reverse engineer the API using sniffers. If you control the device from your phone you can install sniffers on the phone and see the incoming and outgoing requests. But the bigger problem for you is if there is some kind of security mechanism that the device and the app are implementing. The protocol can be encrypted so you wont be able to understand the network traffic or maybe some kind of key that will allow the device to get orders only from a specific app.
So my suggestion, if you are not experienced with this kind of work is to approach the device vendor and ask them for the API, some vendors would be happy to expose it if you would publish your code and let other customers to use it and expand their product.","If there is no documented API you can, in theory,  to reverse engineer the API using sniffers.

Networking: How do wifi enabled IoT products allow remote access?,"I have been looking for an answer to this problem, but I cannot find what I am looking for. I think, perhaps, it is because I lack the knowledge to ask the question in meaningful way.I have been learning a lot about remote access to devices at home. I know that ISP's change public IP addresses regularly (dynamic IP address). I know that to get around this, one could use a service like ""no-ip"", etc. Or one could get a static IP address.What I do not understand is how some of the latest home automation devices are able to be controlled remotely without use of a static IP, or a service like ""no-ip"". For example, a wifi enabled thermostat, or lighting system.If the device had a built in server, or client, then I assume that the device could connect to an outside server in a remote location. The user could then also log into that server and send commands to the device. What I don't understand is how commands sent to the device from a cell phone, for example, can reach the home device. Presumably the off site location of the server would have to know the public IP address where the devise is located, and then port-forwarding would have to be set up to allow access to the device.What am I missing here? Is it possible to create a homemade wifi enabled thermostat, webcam, or other device without using port-forwarding, no-ip, or a static IP?Well, there are several ways to bypass the inbound connection constraint of NAT protocol. Such as:Some devices ""phone home"" to a server so that there are ports open between them and the servers, and the mobile apps just contact the servers. This is the same way your web browser can receive web pages from a web server. If you have a NAT router, the router must open a port from the inside device to the outside server. This is maintained in a NAT table with expiration timers for UDP and session monitoring for TCP.","Well, there are several ways to bypass the inbound connection constraint of NAT protocol. Such as:A virtual adapter on the device configured to a VPN server that has an inbound port open ready to transfer data. Various open source solutions such as openVPN are considered as great examples for this service over IOT boards like Raspberry Pi, Beagle Bone, etc. These are used as gateways often. Further, they communicate with the microcontrollers over popular IOT protocols such as MQTT, COAP, etc.Another solution is to create a port forwarding tunnel, since the router won't block the outbound connection. There are various tunneling services that are availble such as , , etc. You could also use a cloud server that has a public IP such as AWS, DigitalOcean, etc. Again as above mentioned point, they can be implemented in the gateways.

picking a shardkey for mongodb,"I want to shard my MongoDB database. I have a high insert rate and want to distribute my documents on two shards evenly.I have considered rangebase sharding, because I have range queries; but I can not find a solution for picking a good shard key.If this is my document and I have 100,000 different machines, would the Machine_ID be a suitable shardkey? And if so, how will MongoDB distribute it on the shards, i.e. do i have to specify the shard range myself? like put Machine_ID 0-49,999 on shard A, and 50,000-100,000 on shard B?I think the  would be a suitable shard key if your queries afterwards will be per Machine, i.e. get all the temperatures for a specific machine for a certain time range. Reading more about shard keys can be found here: MongoDB has two kinds of sharding: Hashed sharding and Range sharding which you can read more about here: . Having said that, you don't need to specify the range of the shards yourself, mongo will take care of it. Especially when a time comes when you'll need to add a new shard, mongo will rearrange the chunks into the new shard.If your cluster has only two shards, then it isn't difficult to design for. However, if your data will continue to grow and you end up having a lot more shards, then the choice of shard key is more difficult.For example, if some machines have many more records than others (e.g. one machine has 3000 records i.e. 3% of the total), then that doesn't cause problems with only two shards. But if your data grows so that you need 100 shards, and one machine still has 3% of the total, then Machine_ID is no longer a good choice: because a single machine's records have to be a single chunk, and cannot be distributed across several shards.In that case, a better strategy might be to use a hash of the Timestamp - but it depends on the overall shape of your dataset.","I think the  would be a suitable shard key if your queries afterwards will be per Machine, i.e. get all the temperatures for a specific machine for a certain time range.

For wall powered IoT device what are the best ways to read data and send commands,"I have a internet connected IoT device (let's say advanced internet connected weather sensor, which can send sensor data and perform some advanced operations like rotating, switching on, opening valves/and few other operations).

This works perfectly for getting readings of the devices sensors. However this approach becomes more problematic when I want to send commands to the devices. Eg. if I want to send command , my central server has to wait until it is contacted by the device and in the Response for the HTTP request - I can put some command, so when the device receives the response, it will actually execute the command.However this approach has flaws: What could be the solutions for this problem?UPDATE:
As @mhopeng suggested, the most flexible solution seems to be turning the device into a ""server"", so that it can accept incoming connections. However, because the considerations of security, firewalls and complexity we cannot go this way. Also device needs to be simple to install: third party maintenance stuff should be able to simply plug the device into wall and ethernet, and it should work. (No need for configuring port forwarding, firewalls, etc).FYI We also use PIC microcontrollers in this device.  details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The article then goes on to describe option 2, :And finally, it details option 3, :"," details three options for sending data from a server to a device.From your description, it sounds like you're using :The most basic way to solve this communication problem is called short polling—a method where the client periodically asks the server if there is new data available for it. This is the simplest solution to code, though it is not recommended if you need to notify a device in real time.The article then goes on to describe option 2, :The next option is long polling. In this case, the client performs the request and the server won’t respond until it has something to send. This enables real-time push notifications from the cloud to devices, though it requires the device to leave the connection open for as long as it needs to listen to the server. Using this technique consumes more energy and also risks the loss of the connection. Consider the case where a device remotely controls the door of a truck. If a long poll request has been made, and then the truck goes into a tunnel, the mobile connection will drop. The device will then need additional logic to kill the hung connection and open a new one.And finally, it details option 3, :A third option is to use newer protocols like CoAp or MQTT, for example, which were designed to provide low latency, small packet sizes and stable communication over weak networks. These newer protocols provide a two-way communication channel, which in turn supports push notifications. This makes them good choices for IoT projects requiring the ability to control connected devices in real time. The only downside could be the lack of firmware libraries and examples for embedded devices, which are significantly more abundant for HTTP-based connections.
  Choosing the right protocol will depend on your application and how often you will need to communicate with a device."

what is the difference between ETSI-M2M standard and OneM2M standard?,"I am doing a project about the topic desinging and implementing an M2M Application using OM2M. When I found some documentation in the internet, I know that the OM2M is defined based on the ETSI-M2M and OneM2M Standard. These two standards make me a bit confused about the similarity. Can anyone tell me what is the difference between these two standards, the ETSI-M2M standard and OneM2M standard? Thank you so much!I will try to help from the standard prospective, not in terms of the implementation
ETSI M2M was developed starting form 2009, and two releases were completed.  In the meantime was identified the need to globalize the solution, so ETSI and its members approched other companies and other Standard Organizations to build a common project, and this is today oneM2M.  It is worth to remember that oneM2M is not a new Standard Organization, it is simply shared Partnership Project among existing organizations to merge the efforts and the expertize to provide better specifications.Technically speaking, the principles are the same, the key Resources are still Applications, Containers and Access Rights (ACP in oneM2M). And the principle of separation of the semantic treatment from the platform is still the same.
So de facto Release 1 of oneM2M is a sort of ""Release 3"" of ETSI M2M. But be careful, they are not backward compatible.Being practical, I would suggest you to look directly at Release 1 and 2 of oneM2M. A lot of improvement has been added by the different partners making it more easily usable.
In particular Release 2 finalizes the semantic interworking framework to be build around the platform, providing inter technology interworking and data sharing.I hope I was usefull.Enrico Scarrone,

MQTT handleMessage Function Not Invoked Despite Subscription,"I'm working on a Go application that subscribes to an MQTT topic and processes incoming messages using a handleMessage function.

I have verified that messages are indeed being published to the topic.Here are the steps I've taken to troubleshoot the issue:Verified MQTT message reception and subscription parameters.
Checked the connection status of the MQTT client and ensured there are no connection errors.
Reviewed the implementation of the handleMessage function to ensure it's correctly defined and exported.

Disconnect clientUsing another client program and another client id, connect to the broker
Publish message to the same topic that was subscribed to by the now offline client.

Rebooting server with MQTT service,"Imagine an MQTT broker with remote clients connected, which continuously send QoS 2 data - the standard situation. Clients are configured with ""cleansession false"" - they have a queue to send messages in case of a connection failure.On the server, local clients subscribe to topics to receive messages.Server load:What if the third point occurs before the second? Are there standard solutions? How not to lose the first messages?Assuming you are talking about all later reboots of the broker, not the very first time the system is started up then the broker should have stored the persistent subscription state of the clients to disk before it was shutdown and restored this when it restarted. This means that it should queue messages for the local clients.Also you can always use a firewall to stop the remote client being able to connect until all the local clients have started, this would solve the very first startup issue as well.","Assuming you are talking about all later reboots of the broker, not the very first time the system is started up then the broker should have stored the persistent subscription state of the clients to disk before it was shutdown and restored this when it restarted.

Feature Database to Generate IOT Scenarios For Different Ecosystems,"We can access/emulate the features of mobile devices in android development tools. However there are lots of IOT devices with different communication capabilities, features and applications. Is it possible to find a database that sorts us the software features and physical capabilities of IOT devices on the market.

Data storage for IoT devices,"How data is stored for Internet of Things devices? Are they stored in traditional relational database format (tables, rows , columns ) or some other format? Is there some software or algorithm applied to raw sensor data to organize them ?
Any reference to research paper is appreciated.IoT data will be stored in various different formats depending on a few factors, but not the least including:The data could be coming directly from a sensor or being relayed from an internet connected device (think cell phone).  If it's coming directly from a sensor and your utilizing the native SDK provided, then it's likely to be coming over in a hard file format or XML.  If you're pinging it off a cell phone, you may be translating the data locally and then pushing it to the server. Depending on your scenario, the format of data coming to server will be defined and you'll need to weigh the processing costs of further format changes with the rest of the considerations below.Depending on how often you access the data, post-ingestion, will determine whether or not you want to stick the values into a NoSQL DB (like SOLR or MongoDB), a relational DB (like SQL) or keep them in file format and store them in Hadoop.  If you're going with Hadoop, I'd suggest Cloudera over other flavors and you'll need to keep in mind the limitation of 100 million files regardless... so don't forget to do your archiving strategy with HAR.You may require that the data be analyzed post-ingestion, and that process may have its own requirements.  For example, during one Mobile ECG build I needed to analyze the data via WFBD (an MIT Open Source Library) which required the files to be fed in a specific format... so we went with a Hadoop archive and a SQL/SOLR active db.Hadoop is accepted across the board by all languages, but specific DB methods will require you to consider whether your going with a .NET approach or a JAVA (or others) approach.Hope this helps!","IoT data will be stored in various different formats depending on a few factors, but not the least including:The data could be coming directly from a sensor or being relayed from an internet connected device (think cell phone).

(IoT) Why does zigbee smart device requires an extra gateway to connect to WAN?,"I am currently studying Internet of Things and found that there are bunch of devices are using zigbee and Wifi. Take Xiaomi smart wifi plug for example, it does not require an extra gateway(router) to connect to WAN. I assume it connects to my LAN via gateway first and the gateway takes it to the WAN. On contrarily, Xiaomi smart Zig-Bee plug requires Xiaomi-gateway to be connected to WAN. My question is why it can not connect to my LAN gateway as the Xiaomi smart wifi plug does. Aren't they all have soc chip on board like a normal pc does?
My reference is from Second, many smart wifi plugs support cell phone that connects to different network other than the one wifi plugs to control the wifi plugs. For example, control your home devices when you're outside. I can not get how this works. I thought devices can only talk to devices that share the same network(LAN). Thanks!Most people have a Wi-Fi gateway to the Internet in their house already (i.e., their router/access point).  A device using Wi-Fi can connect to that existing gateway.  For Zigbee, you need a router that supports Zigbee and connects to the Internet in some way.As for controlling devices from your phone.  If both the smart plug and your phone can connect to the Internet, you can have a publicly accessible server on the Internet that relays messages from the phone to the smart plug.","Most people have a Wi-Fi gateway to the Internet in their house already (i.e., their router/access point).

Is it wrong to log inner working of an IoT device in case of failure?,"I'm currently working on an IoT project and I want to log the execution of my software and hardware.
I want to log them then send them to some DB in case I need to have a look at my device remotely.The wip IoT device will have to be as minimal as possible so the act of having to write very often inside a flash memory module seems weird to me. 
I know that it will run the RTOS OS Nucleus on an Cortex-M4 with some modules connected through SPI.Can someone with more expertise enlighten me ? Thanks.You will have to estimate your hourly/daily/whatever data volume that needs to go into the log and extrapolate to the expected lifetime of your product. Microcontroller flash usually isn't made for logging and thus it features neither enduring flash cells (some 10K-100K write cycles usually compared to 1M or more for dedicated data chips - look it up in the uC spec sheet) nor wear leveling. Wear leveling is any method which prevents software from writing to the same physical cell too frequently (which would e.g. be the directory for a simple file system).
For your log you will have to create a quite clever or complex method to circumvent any flash lifetime problems.
But the problems don't stop there: usually the MCU isn't able to read from Flash memory when writing to it where ""writing"" means a prolonged (several microseconds up to milliseconds depending on the chip) sequence of instructions controlling the internal Flash statemachine (programming voltage, saturation times, etc.) until the new values have reliably settled in the memory. And, maybe you guessed it, ""reading"" in this context also means reading instructions, that is you have to make sure that whichever code and interrupts that may occur during the Flash write are only executing code in RAM, cache or other memories and not in the normal instruction memory. It is doable but the more complex the SW system that you are running above the HW layer, the less likely it will work reliably.","You will have to estimate your hourly/daily/whatever data volume that needs to go into the log and extrapolate to the expected lifetime of your product.

I am not able to figure out how we can send data using HTTP POST to Kafka server. Also, are there any good real life examples present on web which shows detailed configuration of KAFKA cluster that will be really helpful for beginner like me.First, you should know that sending messages with HTTP is suboptimal, compared to Kafka native TCP-based protocol.
But let's say that you know all that and still want to use HTTP.
You need to bring up the Kafka REST Server in order to receive messages over HTTP.

how to connect a programmed raspberry pi to a Kaa platform?,"I have some sensor nodes. they are connected to a Raspberry Pi 2 and send data on it. the data on Raspberry Pi is sending the data to Thingspeak.com and it shows the data from sensor nodes.

Many thanks, 
Shid Mashid. From what I know, to use a KAA server, you should utilize the SDK obtained when you create a new application on the KAA server. This SDK also functions as an API key that will connect the device with a KAA server (on a KAA server named with Application Token). The platforms provided for using this SDK are C, C ++, Java, Android, and Objective C. There is currently no SDK for the Python platform.","Mashid.

I came to know that arduino cant work on that temperature range.I need to deploy something into a freezer like thing which can sense the -°C temperature and send it to the cloud or send it to some controller(wire less) near by and that controller will send the data to raspberry-pi or cloud.Thank you for the valuable commands.,"Temperature range depends on used sensor (some sensors can measure temperatures from -200°C).Temperature range for other electronic is not so good.
Basically you can use internally heated encapsulation, but it is not suitable for battery application.
Or you can place inside only the sensor and rest of circuit will be outside. "

Embedded wifi device that can accept terms on a captive portal?,"I'm building out an IoT solution for a client and the network admins are insisting that the devices only connect through the guest network, which has a captive portal with terms of service that must be accepted with a UI button press before gaining external internet access.  Most IoT Solutions I've looked at so far (electric imp, Spark core) explicitly state that they cannot connect to a captive portal. I've seen other higher-level code for automatically interacting with a captive portal but I have not found a solution that allows an embedded wifi device (like the CC3000) to automatically accept terms on a captive portal. Has anyone seen or built a custom wifi stack for something like the CC3000 that can recognize and interact with a captive portal? is there another embedded wifi solution (xbee wifi maybe?) that has had success in this area?I wouldn't solve this problem in the stack. I would go for a high-level code executed automatically after connecting to the network. Some simple script for example which automatically ""presses the UI button"" for you. Depending on the design of that page this may be as simple as a single http-request.Another solution (maybe): Depending on the Wifi-Modules you've chosen the MAC-Addresses of your devices are predicable. Maybe the network admins can add a rule to their config to allow these devices on their guest network without the need of that captive portal.After considering all options, I believe we are going to go embed the behavour into the SparkCore firmware and insert a captive portal check in the wifi connection code. spark_utilities.cpp line 807 (Internet_Test function)

Real time analytics Time series Database,"I'm looking for a distributed Time series database which is free to use in a cluster setup up mode and production ready plus it has to fit well in the hadoop ecosystem.I have an IOT project which is basically around 150k Sensors which send data every 10 minutes or One hour, so I'm trying to look at time series database that has useful functions like aggregating metrics, Down-sampling, pre-aggregate (roll-ups) i have found this comparative in this Google stylesheet document  .I have tested Opentsdb, the data model of the hbaserowkey really suits my use case :  but the functions that sill need to be developed for my use case are :I have tested also keirosDB which is a fork of opentsdb with a richer API and it uses Cassandra as a backend storage the thing is that their API does all what my looking for downsampling rollups querying multiples metrics and a lot more.I have tested Warp10.io and Apache Phoenix which i have read here  that it will be used by Ambari Metrics so i assume that its well suited for time series data too.My question is as of now what's the best Time series Database to do real time analytics with requests performance under 1S for all the type of requests example : we want the average of the aggregated data sent by 50 sensors in a period of 5 years resampled by months ?Such requests I assume can't be done under 1S so I believe for such requests we need some rollups/ pre aggregate  mechanism, but I'm not so sure because there's a lot of tools out there and i can't decide which one suits my need the best.I'm the lead for Warp 10 so my answer can be considered opinionated.Given your projected data volume, 150k sensors sending data every 10 minutes, it is a mean of 250 datapoints per second and less than 40B on a period of 5 years. Such a volume can easily fit on a simple Warp 10 standalone, and if you later need to have a larger infrastructure you can migrate to a distributed Warp 10 based on Hadoop.In terms of requests, if your data is already resampled, fetch 5 years of monthly data for 50 sensors is only 3000 datapoints, Warp 10 can do that in far less than 1s, and doing the automatic rollups is just a matter of scheduling WarpScript code in a monthly manner, nothing fancy.Lastly, in terms of integration with the Hadoop ecosystem, Warp 10 is on top of things with integration of the WarpScript language in Pig, Spark, Flink and Storm. With the Warp10InputFormat you can fetch data from a Warp 10 platform or you can load data using any other InputFormat and then manipulate them using WarpScript.At OVH we are heavy users of @OvhMetrics which rely on Warp10/HBase, and we provide a protocol abstraction with OpenTSDB/WarpScript/PromQL/... I'm not interested in Warp10, but it has been a great success for us. Both on the scaling challenge and for the use cases that WarpScript can cover.Most of the time we don't even leverage hadoop/flink integration because our customers needs are addressed easily with the real time WarpScript API.For real time analytics, you can try , an open source project maintainted by Apache, or you can also check out database specialized for IoT:  and . The best way is to test these databases yourselves and see if they suit your need. You can also connect these databases as a sink to Kafka. When you are dealing with IoT project, you need to forecast if you have to maintain large data set in the future or if you are happy with downsampled data. Some TSDB have good compression like InfluxDB, but others may not be scalable beyond tens of terabytes, so if you think you need to scale big, look also for one with scale-out architecture.

Both on the scaling challenge and for the use cases that WarpScript can cover.Most of the time we don't even leverage hadoop/flink integration because our customers needs are addressed easily with the real time WarpScript API.For real time analytics, you can try , an open source project maintainted by Apache, or you can also check out database specialized for IoT:  and . The best way is to test these databases yourselves and see if they suit your need. You can also connect these databases as a sink to Kafka. When you are dealing with IoT project, you need to forecast if you have to maintain large data set in the future or if you are happy with downsampled data. Some TSDB have good compression like InfluxDB, but others may not be scalable beyond tens of terabytes, so if you think you need to scale big, look also for one with scale-out architecture. "

Message hangs (timeout) when sending from Azure Web App to Azure IoT Hub Devices,"Below I present a part of an Azure Web App that handles a device notification logic. What I'm doing is invoking the code shown below from a ASP MVC Controller.

It's better, but I doesn't work right. For first couple of times (one or two) it works ok, but then it happens again, the wrapped thread hangs.The code is not far different from the one on MSDN for a console application.

MQTT: How to know when all retained messages have been received,"After subscribing to an MQTT topic (that may include wildcards), is there a way to know for sure that all retained messages for the subscribed topics have been received?(to be more accurate : all messages that were stored retained message at the broker at the moment of subscription) If there is no direct way, is  there any hack to know it (like sending a new retained message with specific QoS  to a subscribed topic,  that is for sure received after older messages) ?Background of my question is this feature request () that I want to implement.So this would be the reference implementation for arduino (ESP8266) with the AsyncMQTT library, but my question is valid in general for other implementations, too (eg using paho-mqtt etc.).  Short answer, No.The client has no way of knowing what topics may have a retained message waiting on them at any point, let a lone at the time of subscribing.The only thing you can do is to make sure you subscribe at QOS 1 or 2 at which point the broker will make every effort to deliver them to you.The only indication would be the arrival of the first none retained message as the broker should (I think) deliver all the retained messages before any new ones.  Edit: messages on have the retained bit set when being delivered as part of a new subscription, later messages get the bit striped by the broker.If your broker supports  topic like  or  you could subscribe to  (for Aedes) to get a message when your client connects and so, based on @hardillb answer, when you get that message it means that all retained messages have been received because it would be sent after all retained.","Short answer, No.The client has no way of knowing what topics may have a retained message waiting on them at any point, let a lone at the time of subscribing.The only thing you can do is to make sure you subscribe at QOS 1 or 2 at which point the broker will make every effort to deliver them to you.The only indication would be the arrival of the first none retained message as the broker should (I think) deliver all the retained messages before any new ones.

MySQL query time too long in sensor timestamped data table,"I have a very simple table to log reading from sensors. There's a column for sensor id number, one for sensor reading and one for the timestamp. This column is of SQL type Timestamp. There's a big amount of data in the table, a few million rows.When I query for all rows before a certain timestamp with a certain sensor id number, sometimes it can take a very long time. If the timestamp is far in the past, the query is pretty fast but, if it's a recent timestamp, it can take up to 2 or 3 seconds.It appears as if the SQL engine is iterating over the table until it finds the first timestamp that's larger than the queried timestamp. Or maybe the larger amount of queried data slows it down, I don't know.In any case, I'm looking for design suggestions here, specifically to address to points: why is it so slow? and how can I make it faster?Is there any design technique that could be applied here? I don't know much about SQL, maybe there's a way to let the SQL engine know the data is ordered (right now it's not but I could order it upon insertion I guess) and speed up the query. Maybe I should change the way the query is done or change the data type of the timestamp column.Use  to see the execution plan, and verify that the query is using a suitable index. If not, verify that appropriate indexes are available.An  is stored ""in order"", and MySQL can make effective of use with some query patterns. (An InnoDB table is also stored in order, by the cluster key, which is the PRIMARY KEY of the table (if it exists) or the first UNIQUE KEY on non-NULL columns.)With some query patterns, by using an index, MySQL can eliminate vast swaths of rows from being examined. When MySQL can't make user of an index (either because a suitable index doesn't exist, or because the query has constructs that prevent it), the execution plan is going to do a full scan, that is, examine  row in the table. And when that happens with very large tables, there's a tendency for things to get slow.Q: Why is it so slow?A: There are several factors that affect the elapsed time. It could be contention, for example, an exclusive table lock taken by another session, or it could be time for I/O (disk reads), or a large ""Using filesort"" operation. Time for returning resultset over a slow network connection. It's not possible to diagnose the issue with the limited information provided. We can only provide some suggestions about some common issue. Q: How can I make it faster?A: It's not possible to make a specific recommendation. We need to figure out where and what the bottleneck is, and the address that. Take a look at the output from  to examine the execution plan. Is an appropriate index being used, or is it doing a full scan? How many rows are being examined? Is there ""Using filesort"" operation? et al.Q: Is there any design technique that could be applied here?A: In general, having an appropriate index available, and carefully crafting the SQL statement so the most efficient access plan is enabled.Q: Maybe I should change the way the query is done A: Changing the SQL statement may improve performance, that's a good place to start, after looking at the execution plan... can the query be modified to get a more efficient plan? Q: or change the data type of the timestamp column.A: I think it's very unlikely that changing the datatype of the TIMESTAMP column will improve performance. That's only 4 bytes. What would you change it to?  Using  would take 7 bytes.In general, we want the rows to be as short as possible, and to pack as many rows as possible into a block. Its also desirable to have the table physically organized in a way that queries can be satisfied from fewer blocks... the rows the query need are found in fewer pages, rather than the rows being scattered onesy-twosy over a large number of pages.With InnoDB, increasing the size of the buffer pool may reduce I/O.And I/O from solid state drives (SSD) will be faster than I/O from spinning hard disks (HDD), and this especially true if there is I/O contention on the HDD from other processes.","Use  to see the execution plan, and verify that the query is using a suitable index.

Creating nested IoT field gateways with Azure and AWS,"From what I have read and understood from their documentation is that only single layer IoT hierarchies can be maintained with either of their gateways. That is a field gateway(sort of like a smart router) sits between the server and edge devices and does the preprocessing and edge computing.What I am wondering is whether field gateways provided from either vendor(AWS or Azure) can be nested as parent and children to create multi-layered IoT device hierarchies. That is gateways connected to gateways and so on.EDIT - This kind of hierarchies would create Fog networks which would enable sub-networks within the hierarchy to function more independently without being over-reliant on the server. Also, they'd reduce the load on the server if the edge gateway could do edge computing while reducing latency as well.Currently the edge device only able to communicate with Azure IoT Hub directly. It doesn't support nest multiple Azure IoT Edge gateways.However, this capability is planning on adding to the product. This feature will be considered in the future but unfortunately there is no timeline yet.","Currently the edge device only able to communicate with Azure IoT Hub directly.

How to reach my IOT device from everywhere without static IP,"I am able to access to my IOT device if I assign it a static IP with a service like dydns. But I would like to be able to reach it without relying on something.I was thinking that my IOT device could ,on every start, write in a database its IP adress so my script on the server knows its ip. The problem is that the IP will correspond to my hotspot IP. I am missing the connection part ""hotspot -->IOT device"".For example I would like to be able to connect my IOT device to my mobile phone in hotspot mode.One way to do this would be to re-design your system: if when it comes online the IoT device always connects (and stays connected) to a server component (which has a well-known/unchanging hostname/IP address), then the server can always send the IoT device a command over that TCP connection without knowing the hostname/IP address of the IoT device, and without it having to be contactable from the internet, i.e. this approach is firewall-friendly at the device end.This is how the IoT is architected when using e.g. MQTT: devices connect inwards to the MQTT broker (i.e. server). MQTT also removes the need for the server application itself to need to connect to the clients. MQTT uses a concept called publish/subscribe with pre-agreed 'topics' - the client will subscribe to a 'command' topic, the server app publishes commands to that topic and the broker handles forwarding the command to the device. Incoming data from the device is published to another topic and the server application subscribes to that topic, the broker forwards the published data. You can try pub/sub example (using a browser, but real devices can also connect to the same server) using e.g. ","One way to do this would be to re-design your system: if when it comes online the IoT device always connects (and stays connected) to a server component (which has a well-known/unchanging hostname/IP address), then the server can always send the IoT device a command over that TCP connection without knowing the hostname/IP address of the IoT device, and without it having to be contactable from the internet, i.e. this approach is firewall-friendly at the device end.This is how the IoT is architected when using e.g. MQTT: devices connect inwards to the MQTT broker (i.e. server).

Why the mqtt connection over 1883 port to IBM Watson IoT Platform does not work?,"I've created a new Watson IoT Platform service but I can't connect devices to over port 1883 (following the documentation instructions).Newly provisioned Watson IoT Platform services now mandate that devices connect over TLS (i.e., port 8883), rather than port 1883. You can change your service's security policy by going to Security > Connection Security and changing the default rule. ""TLS Optional"" will allow you to connect to 1883.This change has been made because it ensures that Watson IoT Platform is secure out of the box: it is then a conscious decision by your administrator to lessen the security should you wish to connect to port 1883.","Newly provisioned Watson IoT Platform services now mandate that devices connect over TLS (i.e., port 8883), rather than port 1883.

Storing checkbox value on server side,"For my home automation project (using a Raspberry Pi with an Apache server and a configuration webpage) I'm trying to save a checkbox's setting to a file on the server side, but I can't get it working in my situation.
Using php with fopen() and fwrite() I can store any string into a text file, that's no problem. The issue is that the form uses POST and I can't seem to figure out how to write my code in such a way that:1) the checkbox itself is set to the value that is currently present in the text file ('remembering and retrieving' the setting);2) the setting that was just set by the user is written to the file, which happens when the page loads (POST).These actions seem to get in eachother's way because php is server side. If the page is refreshed or visited for the first time there's no problem, the problem exists in reloading the page after the form is submitted.
It doesn't really matter which method or language I use to save the checkbox's setting on the server side.Which method could do the trick?You can set the file by doing something like this, assuming that the file only contains the value 1 or 0 if the checkbox should be set or not (call this script when submitting the form):This is to put the checkbox in right format on screen. Use this when displaying the checkbox form.Be sure to set the right permissions when creating the file so that the PHP processor has write access to it.Can you post the fopen(), fwrite() code?

XSD Backward compatibility,"I have a XSD file with a schema that is used to define an XML interface for sending values into my application from remote clients. Right now, the XSD have, lets say for simplicity 3 elements. So in order to serialize and deserialize this in C# I can use the tool xsd.exe to generate C# classes and use those classes to serialize and deserialize XML with respect to the XSD.This works, but then lets say I create a new version of the XSD, with a new fourth element to enable some server-side feature available if this element is specified for new remote clients, but I still want to support the old XSD (dont want or can change the software of the old remote clients), but the new classes generated from the new XSD wont be compatible with the old XMLs from the old XSD.I suppose I could read the XML's directly with XDocument or similar, but I want to have the feature of only accepting XML's that can be validated against one of the XSD (and then take server-side decision depending on which XSD version it validates against). This is due to customer relation issues.What is best practice to deal with this issues?If I understand you correctly then you shouldn't need to support multiple XSD's if all you are trying to do is add an additional element to the schema. Instead, if you set the 'minOccurs' value to 0 for this new element and regenerate the CS file and use this to de-serialize your objects this should allow you to de-serialize requests for when the element is present and when it is not present. You can then just evaluate if the Property on the de-serialized object is null to determine whether the new feature should be enabled or not. See example XSD below:Best practice is to avoid data binding technology if your schema is likely to change, especially if you need to handle multiple variants. Basically, XML is designed for flexibility and languages like C# aren't, so if you compile C# code to reflect a specific schema then you are locking yourself in. Data binding is great if nothing changes, but if you need to handle variety and change then either use a generic approach (such as DOM) or use XML-specific processing languages such as XSLT and XQuery.","If I understand you correctly then you shouldn't need to support multiple XSD's if all you are trying to do is add an additional element to the schema.

On-screen keyboard in Windows Universal App on Windows IoT?,"Is it possible to show the On-Screen Keyboard (osk) in a Windows Universal App on Windows 10 IoT Core?

This is a pretty good keyboard but it would be better to have the default windows keyboardIf it was up to me I would prefer the default OSK since you can specify slightly different keyboard layouts based on inputs.

More specifically, here is the command I call to publish to the topic (from my Java app): Where the ""publish"" method is defined as follows: All that happens is that I enter the method, I get ""About to send!"" printed on my console as the code specifies, and then the actual 'client.publish(topic, mqttMsg)' call blocks my program indefinitely.. Eventually, after blocking for a while, I get the following error: Thanks for the help!If you are publishing from an application, are you specifying the device type and device id?

IBM IoT Real-Time Insights and multiple map events,"I am using IBM IoT Real-Time insights and sending in an event which contains:
When I send in an event, the map correctly updates with the correct marker as expected:However, when I send in a second event without changing any of its content, the map changes and shows the following marker position:My gut is telling me that the second event is providing coordinates of 0, 0 ... but it is exactly the same event as the first.  If I select a new dashboard and go back to the first with the map, this pattern repeats.  The next event shows fine and the one after that shows me West Africa.  I am able to trivially recreate.The resetting of latitude and longitude coordinates with the maps widget is a limitation that is currently being addressed by the IoT Real-Time Insights team.

"How do I test if the server code can handle requests from 10,000 Raspberry Pi's? [closed]","I am currently in an internship for this Internet of Things company that has written their server code in Javascript. I will try to run the code that regulates connection between their Gateway (the device that will send and receive information to the server).The gateway uses Raspberry Pi units to do the communication. My question is, how do I do stress tests to see if the server will accept up to 10,000 Raspberry Pi's? I found tools like 
But are there other ways to do it? Like using virtual machines to test whether 10000 RSPi's will be handled? And second part of the question, how can I test the firmware of raspberry pi IoT without the hardware, like through a virtual machine. Is that possible??Any pointer about to where to find this stuff would be greatl appreciated!!I think you're approaching it wrong - it doesn't matter that the clients are Raspberry Pis or that there are 10k of them. You load test to find out how many QPS (queries per second) your server can handle within acceptable response times. This is what tools like ab, JMeter, vegeta, locust, etc. are made for. Then figure out how many QPS you expect to be generated - how often are the RPis going to be making calls? Multiply that by 10k and you have your expected load. There is no reason to actually simulate 10k RPis explicitly.","I think you're approaching it wrong - it doesn't matter that the clients are Raspberry Pis or that there are 10k of them.

If so how can i fix it?Thank for your attention. After a while, I finally found out where the problem was laid.
I tried to change the ROM memory allocation for SoftDevice and main program and it finally works.Basically SoftDevice allocation must be bellow the main program in the memory. For example if we have memory form 0x00 to 0xff, The SoftDevice can be allocated from 0x00 to 0x2f and the remained area from 0x2f to the end must be reserved for main program.Depending on which SoftDevice(SD) you use eg. S110, S130 etc. , The size of SDs can vary So the memory allocation of SDs start from 0x00 but the ending point depends on which SD you use, So I changed the memory allocation address in Kiel, And can get information about SDs compatibility with nRF devices and SDs features in the site :  Here is another helpful link :","After a while, I finally found out where the problem was laid.

1. For each sensor data is being sent once every couple of days (up to 6 times a month)
2. each sensor reading contains about 5000 events that are encapsulated in 50-100 messages that are sent to the server (such ""session"" takes about 20 minutes where messages are sent every 5 seconds)
3. I am building the system to handle rate of 30,000 messages per second.
4. processing of the data shouldn't be real time , I have about 10 minutes once the ""session"" is finished to do the processing.
5. 90% of the sessions are not interesting and can be thrown away once they are finished. the other 10% have event or event encapsulated in the messages that according to them I need to decide if I need to process the entire session data and send an alert to the sensor that there is a pollution.I created a tool that generates 5000 messages per second and I am trying to figure out which database would be the most optimal for my scenario.

"Is there a way to create rules, actions, message schemas programatically in IBM Watson IoT platform?","Is there a way to create rules, actions, message schemas from a program using REST APIs?
I want a simple rule to be configured like  do some action. Can this be done programatically?Also, Can this value  be configured somewhere instead of hard-coding in the rule?Are you trying to create the rules so they appear in the real-time dashboard in Watson?  If not, you should be able to create an application with logic.  Have you tried the Node-RED sample that comes with boilerplate, it has logic similar to what you mention and you can customize it. Before RealTime Insights was merged into iot platform we had a specific API to manage rules and actions. Since the merge was applied, it seems that the RTI API is not available anymore.

Port reading application in .Net which is better Windows service or Windows application,"I am writing a TCP/IP port reading application in .Net to read the data from IOT devices, currently it is running as a Windows application. I want to make it a Windows service, is there a better option? I want to read the ports 24/7. Is there any better options than a Windows service?If you want to be able to run the program with no user logged on, then a windows service is the way to go. If you want some graphical user interface, a normal application is more useful.As a side node, you can change an application with debug-flags between starting as a service and starting as an application. Add a Service-Class to your app and another class for your custom code. The service will also call the Sample class. Then you can switch between using each during debug if you add a precompiler #if DEBUG in the Program.csthen you can also add code for output that works differently for each build-typeThen if you start the app choose between build and debug. But you can only install the release-build as service this way.Yes, a windows service would be fine. I'd like to use a little library called  to make a service / console app. Then I'd add  to expose the service and it's data (or read it from a shared database).You also asked if there was a 'better' way. You might argue that polling all the IoT devices isn't a good idea (you might use too many resources). Let them broadcast their reading (when they see fit) to a message queue (most of those little devices like to use ). Then your application should only subscribe to the desired queues and process the data when needed.There can be multiple reasons to choose one or the other but here are some suggestions which might help you to decide.you mentioned 24/7 so Windows Service should be your choice without question.
BUT you will need to consider the following Make sure that you put all your configurable values in the config file. for e.g. listening port, intervals or any other things which you might wanna change without recompiling / re-deploying, as you wont have UI to control it.You could also have all these settings stored in a json or xml file for which you can create a separate UI just to manage that setting file, while windows service works just reads from these settings.To go one step further you can also add code to your windows service with starts in process web api endpoint which responds to rest requests to manipulate service configuration and/or actions/commands you may want to deliver to your windows service. this would allow the windows service to run in background with or without user session and can also be controlled from a separate machine via rest calls. BUT these are just some ideas and how much you do depends on how much you need to do.An application is a program which you interact with on the desktop.Microsoft Windows Service is specifically designed to address an issue of 24/7 service up time and get away from GUI oriented Form Applications, 
C# provides very nice and easy to use samples of how to develop Windows Services. Along with error logger system it can be integral part of your solution. 
In order your Windows service to be debugger friendly you can put it on  technology.I used it in my experience and it greatly reduced development/debugging time .I have no experience of writing a service in .NET, and I've always got the impression that it becomes trickly to debug.You asked for a ""better option"", this is an alternative option but whether it is better will depend very much on your requirements: So, as an alternative, have you considered the task scheduler? I have a number of command line applications in .NET that I can run and debug inside Visual Studio and which are then called by the task scheduler when they need to be run periodically. If you want to use the task scheduler then just be sure that it doesn't require any user interaction (and no gui), but the same restrictions would apply to service. If it is for a long running application (which yours seems to be) then you could use the task scheduler to set it running, and if you wanted you could use the task manager to periodically restart it if it isn't still running.Services are more appropriate for some things. Certainly they are easier to stop than something running off the task scheduler (because for the task scheduler you would have to find the process in task manager to kill it).It might be worth considering WHY you want to make it run as a windows service. If it is only as a means of setting it running when your machine starts then a scheduled task would be just as good. If it is because you want experience in writing a windows service then do it as a windows service. etc.Why rebuild the wheel ?

Our own web Services vs IoT`s APIs to have highest security,"I have two scenarios for implementing IoT devices and I want to know which one has most security? Because I am a programmer and I have bit knowledge on network issues is to implement IoT devices and have modification and configuration from outside of local network. Assume we have IoT device in smart house and I want to change its configuration from outside of house by changing some parameters.NOW: 
On the below picture indicates with red color on the left. Writing our own web services and make it accessible by setting up ""static ip"" and and using ""Port Forwarding"" + SSH in order to have high secure connection.In this story, user write static ip on address bar from outside of smart house and connect to web services and can have modificationnow my question is if this way can harmful for our firewall and network?
If this way open firewall port permanantly?
If all users can send request so do we have attackers that can attack other devices or not?We can have our authentication to have more safty. 
On the below picture indicates with blue color on the right. In this scenario we are using APIs from IoT company instead of writing our own services and user send request to IoT Company and on the our smart house we have gateway from IoT company which send request for instance per 1 second to check if ther is any on IoT company server or not and if there is any so make a modification.Because in this scenario Iot Company might to use DHCP IP instead of static ip , is it possible to have some hurt to fire wall?Because I am not sure but I think firewall will be opened whenever ther is any request so is it possible that this way is more secure? If possible, I would suggest not opening any port on the IoT device. This does create a lot of worries as the question suggests.Instead, would it make sense in your case to have the IoT device poll a web service for instructions? You could use web sockets or long-polling if it's important for the devices to be highly responsive to incoming requests.Mahsa's description is not detailed enough, so i decided to add some more information... otherwise it would be a  discussion.The  uses port forwarding.

It has to talk over the gateway/bridge with the IoT-device.
This means you have to setup a local webserver parallel to the IoT-gateway.

similarities and differences between FIteagle and OpenIot frameworks,"I m trying to understand better the two frameworks therfore i m trying to figure out the similarities and differences between FIteagle framework and OpenIot because both of the frameworks includes the same aims, the first one provides a testbeds environments which provide different resources to manage and communicate with and the second one provides the possiblity to connect to different sensors within a database cloud and it provide the ability to communicate with the sensors and to aply some IoT services on it. Does anyone has an idea about the two frameworks ?Not being familiar with any of the above frameworks, I would say that eventually all IoT frameworks will focus on virtual markets in order to deliver industry-specific services.

Is REST API over SSH possible?,"I am designing an API for  communication between an IoT device and a client. A must is that that the client-device connection is  and no man-in-the middle can temper the communication or attack the devices, including the routing server. The network diagram is the following:The clients must be able to execute commands on the IoT devices via an API server running on each IoT device. The routing server only tunnels the requests, but .My question is:What protocol should I use to implement this scheme?I am a little confused over . 
I don't need direct access to the device's shell, I need a layer of abstraction, provided by an API running on the IoT device. If SSH is not an option, can I securely route requests and execute commands on the IoT device from the  in any other way?The way to do it is just to use HTTPS and certificate pinning (this is very similar to what SSH does under the hood).On the first request to the IoT device, the user pins the device's certificate - after confirming that it is the correct one.Once we have the certificate we just expose the REST API over the insecure proxy. Everything from then on is handled by the TLS protocol automatically.The security guarantees are the same, as with the SSH protocol.Rest API designed to interact under HTTP protocol.
SSH protocol is completely different than HTTP.Because method calling way are different.You can achieve encryption with HTTPS and you can still bind authentication to OS (pam).Otherwise you can make SSH tunnel Host to Host and do HTTP calls.

SSH protocol is completely different than HTTP.Because method calling way are different.You can achieve encryption with HTTPS and you can still bind authentication to OS (pam).Otherwise you can make SSH tunnel Host to Host and do HTTP calls. (Sure, you can automate all process)"
How to get realtime data from hardware sensors and see the results in Kaa platform?,"I have made a single node of Kaa platform. on the other side, I have some sensors, like temperature, humidity and so on.Now I want to connect these sensors to the single node of Kaa and receive data from them and see the recorded data in my application.

Duplicate Lifecycle Events,"I am building a web app that uses AWS IoT lifecycle events and logs device connection/disconnection.
Using AWS IoT rules, I am sending all events to a lambda and after some validation I'm saving all lifecycle events to a DynamoDB table. I'm aware that messages may be delayed, out of order and duplicates may happen.
I am validating for all these scenarios, so my connection log is as accurate as possible.My question is: Is it possible for duplicate messages to come with a distinct timestamp? Such as a disconnection being sent twice with the same  but a different timestamp?Just some guessesReference: ","Just some guessesMQTT QoS 1 implies the ""You might receive duplicate messages."" thing. The message could be resend by one side if no ack is received from the other side. Thus, it is the same old message, and the timestamp would not change.The timestamp field refers to the time the event occurred, not the time the message is sent. Thus, it should remain the same value.Reference: "

Control sonoff with mqtt or http?,"I am wondering what is suitable for my case, using espeasy or Tasmota. I know espeasy is using http requests and Tasmota is using mqtt.I want to control my sonoff devices by a raspberry pi that is acting as a home automation hub, and it in turn send updates and receives commands from AWSIoT platform. For interacting with AWSIoT platform, it uses mqtt.What are the pros and cons of using either? and will it cause problems if I control several sonoff devices with http, while using mqtt for AWSIoT? or better use mqtt for all AWSIoT and sonoff?I am not an expert on the topic but have tried a few things and got some insight for you on why to prefer MQTT over HTTP.Hope that helps. If you still prefer HTTP checkout the app ""Tasmota control"".","I am not an expert on the topic but have tried a few things and got some insight for you on why to prefer MQTT over HTTP.Security. Remember that the 'S' in IOT stands for security. Joking aside. I have not seen an option for encryption (HTTPS) of the HTTP-traffic for tasmota. (May the internet correct me if I am wrong) So choosing HTTP means your user/password (which are not a requirement but should totally be used) are transfered via URL query parameters as plain text. MQTT has built-in mechanisms for encrypting the traffic. I haven't been able to get that working in my network but I'm trying.Flexibility/Reliability. With MQTT/Tasmota you have the ability to implement automations that do not rely on your home automation hub by having your devices publish MQTT-messages directly to each other for interaction. For example if you would like to implement an emergency off button that turns multiple devices off you do not want that to rely on your home automation server. Doing this with HTTP 'could' be done too but requires all users/passwords of all the devices to reside not only in your home automation hub but also on other single devices.Networking. Adding new devices to your hub should be as easy as possible. In matters of HTTP your home automation hub has to know how to find your devices via IP-addresses or domain names since it has to resolve a URL. When using MQTT you just connect your tasmota devices to your broker and use their topic in the home automation hub. The devices do not even need to have a static IP or reachable domain name of mDNS name of any sort. That's in an essence what makes pub/sub for IOT so interesting in the first place.Existing support. Before building your own home automation solution be sure to check out home assistant (my favorite) or any of the other home automation solutions if they fit your need. Do not reinvent the wheel. A tipp for home assistant: Do not use MQTT auto discovery in combination with tasmota. This is the only thing that has not worked out for me. Manually registering devices works reliably.Hope that helps. If you still prefer HTTP checkout the app ""Tasmota control""."
Send AWS IoT commands from cloud to device over unreliable connections,"We're considering AWS IoT for an upcoming project featuring devices with unreliable network connections. One requirement is to send commands to devices. The commands must be reliably delivered (ack'd) and the devices should also signal success/failure when the commands are completed later. It seems that just publishing commands to an MQTT topic won't ensure the message gets delivered, given that AWS don't support persistent sessions - is this right?We've been speculating about poking the command into an array of commands inside the device shadow's 'desired' state. The device could then ack receipt of the command by replicating the command in the shadow's 'reported' state, and report success/failure by setting an outcome field within the command in the 'reported' state.Given our lack of experience with AWS IoT, does this seem like a sane approach? Or can anyone see anything neater? One nasty thing about this is that the shadow accumulates completed commands, which presumably means that I will eventually need some kind of housekeeping to remove the completed commands to keep the shadow to a reasonable size.Finally, does anyone know how clever the bandwidth use is - if my server adds an element to an array of one hundred elements nested deeply inside the 'desired' state, how much data actually flows over the wire? And similarly when my device moves the element into the 'reported' state.You are right that AWS IoT doesn't support persistence session nor message retention.As for using shadow device to store the command queues, it really depends on the frequency and variety of commands you have. What I can think of:Hope this helps you. ","You are right that AWS IoT doesn't support persistence session nor message retention.As for using shadow device to store the command queues, it really depends on the frequency and variety of commands you have. What I can think of:If it's only used infrequently (e.g. once a month) then probably using shadow device is fine from management and performance perspective. However if it's few commands every few minutes then it becomes huge quickly.If there's only few types of commands (with no parameters) and each will only needed to be executed once at a time, then the command could be the key while ""true"" / ""false"" is the value. The desired can set ""true"" to indicate that device should execute it, then once the device has completed the job, it reports ""false"".Hope this helps you. "

IBM Bluemix disconnecting the MqttAndroidClient after sometime,"I am working on CC2650 sensortag and Bluemix(using IOT starter boilerplate) as a cloud solution.

Please note that every 10 seconds I am publishing the data to server from my android client app. So not sure why it is saying no activity.
Keepalive interval is set to 120 seconds.I confirmed it. It is IBM Bluemix which is disconnecting the client after approx 7 min. During this period client was continuously sending the data in 10 sec interval and that was also visible on the Bluemix device page.Any idea why Bluemix is disconnecting it after 6-7 minutes (It is not fixed but out of 6 in 5 it got disconnected in 7 min and once it was around 6 min).New observation:
The other observation is once it is disconnected then it takes 10-12 retries before I am able to reconnect to Bluemix server. From Mqttv3 client I get the exception ""Unable to connect to server"". But during this period I am able to ping to server through cmdline ping utility.It was because phone cpu was going in sleep mode.

Can't publish data from CC3100 + MSP430F5529 on PUBNUB,"I followed the following tutorial:

Remote resource discovery using coap,"I am trying to create a small academic project in the area of home automation. I explored various protocols and standards in IOT domain and find COAP close to my requirements. The intent is pretty simple: To have a peripheral at home (like bulb, temperature sensor etc) which act as COAP server and expose certain resources and services. Since COAP uses an addressing scheme similar to web, any client having the address of this server shall be able to talk to this COAP server (i.e. peripheral) and control its attributes. I have certain doubts about how a client not present in the same LAN as the server, can discover this server and the resources exposed by it. I understand that COAP facilitates resource discovery using CoRE link format but it seems that it primarily uses multicast which can only work within a LAN. I don't want to put a resource directory server at home and various COAP servers registering with it and then this directory server talking to a server sitting in the cloud. I want to have the ability to just install a peripheral at the home which can communicate to a remote client (like COPPER) using wifi home network. But how to discover the COAP server sitting at home from a remote location and then talk to it considering that COAP server will be on a private IP address. 
Is this really possible using just COAP?As you're sitting behind a NAT, that will allow neither direct discovery nor connections; CoAP will not try to magically pierce that.Popular ways out are:For the proxy and IPv6 cases, you can then still run a resource directory in your local network. That does neither need to connect to nor accept registrations from any cloud service, but it can help you do the very discovery that you'd like to do with multicast but can't because your mobile device is too far away. Both the resource directory and the proxy should be configurable to not talk to devices outside the local network unless they are authenticated.Make your router accept HTTP requests , and run a HTTP to CoAP proxy in your system, access your CoAP devices via your IP thought HTTP-CoAP proxy.","As you're sitting behind a NAT, that will allow neither direct discovery nor connections; CoAP will not try to magically pierce that.Popular ways out are:For the proxy and IPv6 cases, you can then still run a resource directory in your local network.

Real time communication between azure cloud and arm-mbed device,"I am trying to establish real time communication between azure cloud and device like arm . mbed is a C/C++ client.
The data is in cloud which is continuous and received by couple of web api.Based on few condition/data processing I need to send command to arm mbed device. 
Currently device is requesting for information every few milliseconds to cloud and this is again handled by web api at cloud side.
we can say it polling from device. This works fine but all the time device needs to check if some commands are available for it or not. Is there a way to improve the scenario? i.e. whenever server is having command it directly pushes the data/command to the device. Can SignalR be used here?I'm not completely sure if Signalr will run on the mbed device. I have successfully used Signalr many times running on Raspberry PIs using Node and also Windows IoT core.

Differences between Device Gateway and MQTT broker in AWS IoT,"I'm studying AWS IoT architecture and I don't understand if there are differences between device gateway and mqtt broker. It seems that in AWS IoT architecture, functions of mqtt broker are performed by the device gateway. Is it right?Yes, it seems the same to me. Apparently, they are talking about ""Gateway to the cloud"" which is different from the usual IoT terminology for gateway which connects sensors to the interent and works as a producer of messages.Regarding the broker, they seem have a more complicated architecture than a simple broker which forwards the messages based on topics (hence the name ""rules engine"").I think you should consider that they are talking about a general architecture for all protocols rather a single one as, for example, the usual publisher-broker-subscriber architecture discussed here for MQTT protocol:

LIFX Z LAN - Lights don't respond when packets are sent quickly,"So I've been trying to make a music visualizer that actually works in real-time.

So I brought them home later to find them still not working on my home network, which I thought was weird. Then I bring them back to school today to find that they are not even working at school anymore! What gives? I'm so stumped on why these things work like a charm out of nowhere, and then stop working again out of nowhere.I try adding a delay, and it works, but the delay is so bad that it's hard to tell that it's even reacting to the microphone at all.I've my GitHub here: and also here's the relevant code:I'm a bit lost on how to handle this elusive problem. Any tips are much appreciated!So to answer my own question, it seems like there's no reliable way to control these lights without some rate-limiting, so at this point I just have a small 0.025 second delay after sending packets, which causes some audio input to not show up in the lights, but it still works as a rudimentary solution.

AWS IoT Shadow : Can I manually try to update reported state of the shadow?,"I have a device that is connected to AWS IoT and it has been reporting delta for quite some time now. I am not sure but for some reason the desired and reported have not been in sync for a while and the device sends unusual number of messages containing delta when interacted with. I can see that the reported state has some left over data from previous operations and I have tried updating the desired but nothing really clears it. Can I send a updateThingShadow request with the reported state to bring them back in sync ? Is there a better way to approach this ?As per  when designing your IoT solution using AWS IoT and shadows, you should determine the apps or devices that will request changes and those that will implement them.In your case, you need to make your device report it's new state (changing the value for the 'Reported' field in the Shadow document) in response to the update request (which changes the value for 'Desired'). That will eliminate the delta between the values for desired and reported.This worked: A few attributes were present in the reported state that were missing in desired which caused a state of permanent delta as desired never updated those fields. I use update thing shadow to pass null to those extra attributes which removed them from the shadow. How those extra attributes got into reported and why they were never removed with updates to desired is still a mystery.","As per  when designing your IoT solution using AWS IoT and shadows, you should determine the apps or devices that will request changes and those that will implement them.In your case, you need to make your device report it's new state (changing the value for the 'Reported' field in the Shadow document) in response to the update request (which changes the value for 'Desired').

Handling SAS tokens using shared access policy (azure storage),"I am sending blobs to an Azure Storage account. I have one customer with 3 IOT clients who each write to their own container.I use a share access policy to create a SAS URI to each container. I am not using an expire data when creating the shared access policy. The generated SAS URI is copied to a config file that each of the clients use this to write blobs to the storage.This works fine. On the client I create the container usingThe token above is retrieved from a config file To send blobs I useNow this works, but I'm not sure if this is the best approach. The reason is that I do not have an expiry on the shared access policy used to create the container SAS token. I don't want to distribute a new SAS token for the container each time it expires (would have to update the config file.
Also I do not want the clients to have access to the storage account key).If a client is compromised I can revoke the shared access policy so the other clients will not be affected. But is this the best approach to solve this regarding security? Input would be appreciated. Using a shared access policy is suggested, however, you may need to notice that you can set up to 5 stored access policies for a container (It looks not a problem for you since there are only 3 IoT clients).You might also want to refer to  for a full list.","Using a shared access policy is suggested, however, you may need to notice that you can set up to 5 stored access policies for a container (It looks not a problem for you since there are only 3 IoT clients).You might also want to refer to  for a full list."

Designing an Embedded System with FoTA Support,"I am working on designing an embedded system that will support a touch screen and will communicate with a motor controller. This device, however needs to support firmware updates via a Wi-Fi module. The following are my specific questions:
Using an ESP266 has been effective in sending data to my server (Apache with MySQL database) but can this module be used to download firmware updates? (I've had a hard time finding anything on this.)
If not what would be a more effective module/approach?What would a typical server setup look like for distributing firmware updates? Would it use TCP/IP or FTP? I don't imagine there would be more 10,000 of these devices distributed and the firmware itself would likely be >=50MB.As far as flashing the firmware goes I was considering having a memory location dedicated to storing updated firmware and having the boot loader check if there is new firmware there. If there is it will begin flashing the new firmware. Whats a good method to ensure this is atomic? Is the bootloader the best place to do this or would something else be more appropriate?The ideal way to distribute a firmware for updates is the least painful one for the user.Having said that, you want security to avoid others meddling with your hardware.
Whether it is going to be FTP, or HTTP or even the SSL/TLS encrypted variations depends on preference.Requirement for secure authenticated firmware updates is a digital signature suite. If your system is capable of running an IP stack, it probably has the resources to squeeze in a signature verification. A commercial solution optimized for embedded systems fits into 4.5kB of ROM and runs completely from the stack (to verify the numbers, go here:  ).This does not protect your firmware from being read out, but it cannot be modified without being noticed by the target system. Basically the bootloader would verify the signature and find out whether the firmware is from the original source and untampered with.If you want to protect your firmware from being read during transmission you could replace the signature software with a TLS/SSL solution. This would increase memory usage.If I look for a solution offered by the same company, there resource usage for the TLS stack is said to be 7k in RAM (see ). They have not published the ROM usage yet, but if I recall correctly it has been something between 20 and 30 kByte.If you do use TLS, create your own certificate! Do not rely on certification servers, as they might be infected. This would be a point 2 point connection anyway, there is noone else involved, so you know which certificate to use and all other certificates can be rejected.On the firmware update protocol:On the scalability:","The ideal way to distribute a firmware for updates is the least painful one for the user.Having said that, you want security to avoid others meddling with your hardware.

What kind of NoSQL storage should we use?,"We are a IoT company that provide services for transportation and logistics companies. As a infrastructure service provider we offer GPS tracking devices to our client.Although the format of GPS tracking data is very neat (gpsId, longitude, latitude, speed, direction, reportTime, etc), but amount of it is very big. Every device report GPS tracking information per 10 seconds, and we have 100k devices, thus 60*60*24*100000/10 = 864M rows of new data generated every day.Using the data collected by GPS tracking device of a particular vehicle, client can review the traces of this vehicle within a given time period (for example, last 10 days, will need 60*60*24*10/10 = 86.4K rows of data).Currently we use MySQL as storage medium, and take advantage of sharding and table partitioning(based on gpsId) of it. But since the data is so big and query on it is so frequent, so I wonder if we can use a NoSQL storage to fit this scenario better?Historical data is also useful for data analysis.Appreciated.It sounds like you want a time series database.

Communicating HART-IP from Java [closed],"In an IoT project I am forced to communicate via HART-IP with an measuring device from my java component. I am a total newbie to HART. I know that is (traditional) HART uses 4-20mA signal modulation to transfer additional information. HART-IP is leveraging HART to Ethernet. I also know that are DTDs, DTMs and FDTs...so far so good.But I haven't found any resources describing how to start using HART-IP, not to mention in combination with Java.I would assume, that with HART-IP I don't have to care about signal modulation anymore but just ""firing"" my commands and receive the response.Has anyone a good starting point for the work with HART-IP?Regards,
ThomasHART-IP is a protocol developed and controlled by the .  It's used to communicate to HART field devices via a network-connected WirelessHART gateway or other HART-IP enabled instruments.In order to get the specifications for the protocol, you need to either become a member of FCG (expensive, but comes with tech support) or purchase them for $1000 (still expensive, but not nearly as much).  You are correct in that you do not have to worry about the 4-20mA signaling modulation with HART-IP, but you will be responsible for setting up the TCP/IP or UDP sockets to the WirelessHART gateway and constructing the frames in accordance with the HART-IP protocol.

From what you are describing, you are trying to develop a HART host application.  There are no APIs or DLLs available for HART-IP so you'll be building from the ground up.In order to get a HART master(host) slack, you have 2 solutions:
 1. Develop code all by your self

Can MQTT broker be configured to send data to subscribers at a different rate?,"I am new to MQTT and working with the mosquitto broker and development libraries. I have a usecase where different subscribers may want to subscribe to a given topic but would want the data at different rates. So, subscriber1 may want it only on change from the previous value while subscriber2 may want it on a fixed cadence, say, every few mins/seconds.Is there a way to configure that in the mosquitto broker? Or any other broker that supports it?With or without MQTT, on PubNub you would need two separate channels: one for delta data and one for regular cadence data and there are three strategies you can employ.The clients wanting only the data changes would subscribe to . The subscribers wanting a regular cadence of data would subscribe to both  and .The publisher would publish data at the regular cadence on  and , publish to . So both types of subscribers get the data they want.Another option with PubNub, you could use  a meta-data value equal to ""1"" if the value has changed from the previous and ""0"" if the value is the same as the last value published. The values would only be published to one channel, .Clients that want all the data would subscribe like normal. But for clients that only want changes,  to only receive messages with that meta-data key set to ""1"". The client inits PubNub as usual, adds the listener (to receive published messages) and subscribes to the channel , but also sets a filter.And now this client will only have messages sent to it if the data has changed while the client without the filter will get all data that is published at the regular cadence.Using  the solution is very similar to the first. The publisher will publish values on a channel named  as long as the data is the same. If the value changes, it will be published to a channel named . The dots () in the channel names are important because clients will be able to subscribe using a wildcard - the asterisk ().Clients that only want changes in the value will subscribe to .And clients that want all of the value in a cadence will subscribe to both of the channels using a wildcard subscribe.This just means that data published to any channel that starts with  and has some  name - , ,  - will receive that data.No, there is no way to configure mosquitto (or any full fledged broker that I am aware of) to do that, it will deliver every message sent to a topic to all subscribers at the rate the publisher sends new messages.If you really must have this feature then the best you could do is probably take something like mosca () and use the hooks it provides to build your own broker, but it would be a nasty hack and it still wouldn't normally redeliver the same message if no new one had arrived for the constant cadence problemBut it would be so much easier to just keep a little state in the clients to throw duplicates away messages and and event loop that just processed the last message if a new one hadn't arrived yet.","With or without MQTT, on PubNub you would need two separate channels: one for delta data and one for regular cadence data and there are three strategies you can employ.The clients wanting only the data changes would subscribe to .

Getting started with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon development,"I have a couple of questions concerning BLE beacons:1)     I want to take up BLE beacon development and struggling to find the right hardware for these needs. As a novice developer I want the beacon to be as cheap as possible in order not to waste money in case of a failure.2)  The reason for choosing Eddystone  is that Eddystone is capable of broadcasting URLs that are essential for me.
The second question stems from my failed attempts to find a pure Eddystone beacon on Chinese electronics sites like alibaba.com or aliexpress.com where the only firmware available is iBeacon. But iBeacon is not an option because it can't broadcast URL the way Eddystone does.  and covered basic topics like: chip to use, beacon model, best website to buy beacons at, etc.Thanks in advance,
Pavel1) I've worked with Estimote beacons and Chinese beacons from Amazon and in my opinion, they do not differ in terms of accuracy too much. Especially for prototyping, I'd buy cheaper ones to test if your use case can be satisfied with BLE beacons. If it is too inaccurate with Chinese beacons, chances are that it won't work with more expensive ones either.2) Why do you need the URL broadcast? If the app is going to use the url, it would have to be connected to the internet. Therefore, you can just query the beacon's IDs to a web service to get back an URL and use that. Personally, I think this is a better approach as you can configure the web service from anywhere to change the url for beacons where as if you want to change the URL of the Eddystone, you have to go to the beacon to configure it.The nRF51822 is a common implementation, is flexible, well understood and can be very inexpensive.  Be aware though that development costs, add on circuitry for power and/or peripherals, and packaging can easily eclipse the Bluetooth chip when you get to production cost savings.If you want to buy an off the shelf beacon, most models supporting Eddystone also support iBeacon, simply because supporting both adds no additional hardware cost.  Newer Radius Networks and Estimote beacons all support both.  And, yes, cheaper generic Chinese suppliers often have bulk manufactured inventory from before Eddystone existed at only support iBeacon.","1) I've worked with Estimote beacons and Chinese beacons from Amazon and in my opinion, they do not differ in terms of accuracy too much.

"Is it possible with ""org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3-1.2.0"" Library in Java to get more than one MQTT message at a time?","I'm new here at Stackoverflow and have a question.I want to create an IoT weather station with a ESP8266 that has two sensors (humidity, temperature) and send the data to a broker (Mosquitto) running on a Pi. Beside the easy way to fetch and visualize the data with nodered I want to program a desktop app in Java.I use the ""org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3-1.2.0"" package to create a client and fetch the messages. With one topic (e.g. ""/test/temperature"") it's easily possible to receive the temperature values. But if I add a second client for humidity, it's not possible to receive the two at the same time. When two clients are implemented just the later called client gets its values.I solved the problem by sending the values from the ESP8266 with a little time shift. But is there a way to fetch to messages at the same time? I thought about Threads but it's not working.Has anyone had already the same problem or got an idea?Thanks in advance and don't hesitate to ask further questions.Cheers.Robin First off, you need to rethink your topic structure.  Don't be so restrictive.  Hand out topics like houses hand out candy on Halloween.  :)i.e.A state machine can be almost anything.  i.e. Hashtable, database, etc..  If you want to keep historical data then I would go with a database. i.e. , , , etc.   I use the “sqlite-jdbc” driver from . The JDBC driver works extremely well and he keeps the code in sync with the SQLite code base.A basic database would have 2 tables: Temperature and Humidity.  Have the client subscribe to both topics and when a message arrives, update the appropriate table with the incoming value and the current date and time.  If you want, you could create a 3rd table (i.e. 'Recent') and it would only ever have 2 rows (one for the current temperature and one for the current humidity) in the table that are constantly replaced.No, messages are not fetched from a broker, they pushed by the broker. The broker will push messages as they arrive and they will always be one at once, this is just how MQTT works.The way to do this is to maintain a state machine that holds the last value for each sensor and use these values to update the output when ever one value changes.","First off, you need to rethink your topic structure.

Fiware for data collection from IOT devices,"I am to design an IOT platform which should collect sensor data from tens of thousands of sources or more. Process this data in different ways and present the user with interactive dashboards which allow the user to drill down through the aggregate information down to the specific device level.

And that's why I started looking into FIWARE.Reading through FIWARE site, different FIWARE architecture documents, GE specific documentation etc. and trying to answer my own design architecture questions. The abundance of available information is confusing to say the least.

If I am to use FIWARE GEis as a device proxy which receives data from devices and forwards to the realtime processing pipeline, which GEis should I use? And which specific implementations?

Occasionally I need to run ad-hoc queries and will stand up a Hadoop cluster on top of the Blob Storage.  When Azure Data Lake Hits GA, Azure Data Lake Analytics with U-SQL will become my go-to ad-hoc query.The Azure IoT Hub specifically allows for very simple set up and coding for devices, 1 line of code and also enables bi-directional communication device to device, device to cloud and cloud to device.  Coupled with the massive scale it allows, this has become my go-to IoT message passing platform and I use in every solution now.Microsoft has pushed out what is called the ""IoT Suite"", which I am finding very easy to roll out for these scenarios.

Is there a limit on how many devices can access the asynchronous webserver of an ESP32?,"I'm trying to make an easy access ESP32 asynchronous webserver where people within the office network can check the device and give it a set of commands. First few tests with my mobile device and laptop worked quite well but as of now there seems to be only me who can access the webserver's IP.I have an assumption why this is: it could be because I use my personal access ID and password for the WiFi network on both mobile device and laptop.Another assumption is that there is a limit on how many devices the ESP32 can respond to.Does anybody have experience with this? I certainly can't find anything with basic googling, probably because I don't know the specific issue.What you want may require hacking into the RADIUS server to authorise all users for accessing the ESP32.If there is some permission set that only allows one person to access specific servers and computers that have the same login credentials, then only you can access the ESP32.I only know vaguely how access to resources is set up in WPA-enterprise networks, but your system administrator should know (they may be angry with you for introducing a server into their network, though).You could try if you can access a coworker's computer over the network to see if they manage access to resources.","What you want may require hacking into the RADIUS server to authorise all users for accessing the ESP32.If there is some permission set that only allows one person to access specific servers and computers that have the same login credentials, then only you can access the ESP32.I only know vaguely how access to resources is set up in WPA-enterprise networks, but your system administrator should know (they may be angry with you for introducing a server into their network, though).You could try if you can access a coworker's computer over the network to see if they manage access to resources."
Why/when to use IoT publish/subscribe protocols rather then RESTful HTTP?,"I am sending data (GPS coordinates) from Arduino once a minute with HTTP POST request to REST API (in OpenShift PaaS). Data is then stored to MySQL db.Would so called ""IoT"" publish/subscribe protocols (XMPP, MQTT) be better? Why?When exactly do you use those two protocols rather than Restful HTTP? Would I really save a significant baterry energy using them?AFAIK in those protocols machine would ""publish"" a data to broker and my app would subscribe to it. If I would like to gather data every minute in my app I guess that I would got to have some CRON job that would subscribe to data every minute? Or how would data gathering be achieved?At small scale (not many sensors) or when the sensors have plenty of power (CPU and electrical), or communication cost is low then there's less reason to use MQTT. Conversely at large scale, or for CPU/electricity-limited sensors or when comms cost is high then MQTT or similar IoT protocol has advantages. You can implement MQTT in a very simple embedded CPU, more complex to implement HTTP.You would save battery power using e.g. MQTT over e.g. 3G because there is less protocol overhead from publishing MQTT data over a persisting TCP connection from MQTT client to broker then there is for every REST POST which usually requires establishing an SSL connection, posting the data using verbose HTTP, then deleting the SSL connection.An MQTT connection is inherently bidirectional (although your app doesn't have to use it) - so you natively get the ability to send commands to your sensors. To do the same using REST/HTTP you have to configure your server for long polling.There is a comparison of long-polling HTTPS vs MQTT over SSL here  which shows ~4.1% battery power/day saved using MQTT compared to slow-polling HTTPS
So yes, you can save significant battery energy.With MQTT you can send very small messages e.g. a few bytes of binary data, with low overhead. With REST/HTTP the data gets wrapped in a lot of HTTP protocol with much higher overhead. If you have lots of devices those overhead bytes add up to a lot more data being sent, which costs money. So at large scale using a compact protocol like MQTT and designing the data transfers carefully saves you money.With MQTT your app usually has a persistent subscription to the topics and is automatically notified of updates. If you want a summary every minute your app will save the updates to e.g. a DB and report from the DB. DB is usually needed to store all the data anyway. You can subscribe to wildcard topics - this means you design your topics so your app subscribes to e.g. all solar sensors and the broker will send data for all the connected devices without your app having to poll the individual sensors.","Would so called ""IoT"" publish/subscribe protocols (XMPP, MQTT) be better? Why?At small scale (not many sensors) or when the sensors have plenty of power (CPU and electrical), or communication cost is low then there's less reason to use MQTT. Conversely at large scale, or for CPU/electricity-limited sensors or when comms cost is high then MQTT or similar IoT protocol has advantages. You can implement MQTT in a very simple embedded CPU, more complex to implement HTTP.When exactly do you use those two protocols rather than Restful HTTP? Would I really save a significant baterry energy using them?You would save battery power using e.g. MQTT over e.g. 3G because there is less protocol overhead from publishing MQTT data over a persisting TCP connection from MQTT client to broker then there is for every REST POST which usually requires establishing an SSL connection, posting the data using verbose HTTP, then deleting the SSL connection.An MQTT connection is inherently bidirectional (although your app doesn't have to use it) - so you natively get the ability to send commands to your sensors. To do the same using REST/HTTP you have to configure your server for long polling.There is a comparison of long-polling HTTPS vs MQTT over SSL here  which shows ~4.1% battery power/day saved using MQTT compared to slow-polling HTTPS

Using IoT platform vs normal web application [closed],"There are a lot of IoT platform in the market like AWS Amazon IoT and Microsoft Azure Hub, I understand all the features that are offered by those platforms.Questions:Of course you can implement your own IoT hub on any web application and cloud (or on-prem) platform, there is nothing secret or proprietary in those solutions. The question is, do you want to do that? What they offer is  of built in functionality that would take you some serious time to get production ready when building it yourself.So: yes, you can build it. Let's compare it to Azure IoT hub and look at what that contains:a) reliable messages to and from hubb) periodic health pulsesc) connected device inventory and device provisioningd) support for multiple protocols (eg HTTP, AMQP, MQTT...)e) access control and security using tokens.... and more. Not supposed to be a full feature list here, just to illustrate that these solutions contains a whole lot of functionality, which you may (or may not) need when building your own IoT solution. when does it make sense to build this yourself? I would say when you have a solution where you don't really neeed all of that functionality or can easily build or setup those parts you need yourself. Building all of that functionality doesn't, generally speaking, make sense, unless you are building your own IoT platform.Another aspect is the ability to scale and offer a solution for multiple geographic locations. A web application on a cloud provider could easily be setup to both autoscale and cover multiple regions, but it is still something you would have to setup and manage yourself. It would likely also be more expensive to provide the same performance as the platform services does, they are built for millions of devices across a large number of customers, their solution will likely look different under the hood.Third is time-to-market, by going with a platform service will get you up and running with your IoT solution fairly quick as opposed to building it yourself. Figure out what requirements you want to support, how you want to scale, how many devices and so on. Then you can do a simple comparison of price and also what it would cost you to build the features you need.","Of course you can implement your own IoT hub on any web application and cloud (or on-prem) platform, there is nothing secret or proprietary in those solutions.

"Raspberry, check electric current","I've searched for many hours a way to detect if electric current is flowing or not using a Raspberry without success.The problem that I'm facing up is, using a Raspberry (powered by an uninterruptible power supply), detect if electric current in my house is ON or not. 
Sometimes the electric current goes down because we've too many devices connected and when the fridge is down for some days is not a good surprise when you discover this.Do someone have a solution?Thanks!What about upgrading to 6kW contract? :) Just jokingWhat about a step down 220v to 3,3V converter connected to a GPIO pin as input? Well, actually maybe better use an optocoupler to stay safe with isolation:Just be sure to have a 3,3V as output, use a level shifter if this guy gives you a 5V as output.
And always be careful when playing around with the mains!If you want to detect voltage, you can use one of the GPIOs set in input mode.

Bluemix NodeRed SQL,"I am using NodeRed to collect data from a CC2650 SensorTag and store it in a SQL database. 
The SensorTag is connected to my phone through the app and the data is pushed to the cloud. My NodeRed application collects this data then stores it to my SQL. However I have found the system will disconnect and is unable to monitor the data for long periods of time. I have two sensortags connected and the data stream seems to randomly stop. I believe it is due to a loss in connection between NodeRed and SQL but am unsure. Is anyone else running a similar programme facing these problems? The data will appear in the NodeRED debug screen and get uploaded to the SQL database in the table. As the data is being sent I can see each point being uploaded as I refresh the table however the upload is not consistent and will sometimes stop uploading to the SQL table despite still being displayed on the debug. So far I have not seen any pattern the data will stop randomly for no clear reason. I have been able to refresh the system and deploy it again to try and get it running again however this is not always successful and only a temporary solution.

Measure CPU speed of IoT devices at different temperatures,"I want to measure the computational speed of a telosB at different temperatures. To program the device I use contiki. 
My idea was to let it send messages in fixed intervals with the return of as content. A second device reads that message and stores it in a file, together with its own clock_time (void) return value. With that I could say:At temperature A, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 600 clock ticks to receive 100 messages.At temperature B, a device needed 500 clock ticks to send 100 messages and the second device needed 800 clock ticks to receive 100 messages. This would mean that the device truly is slower at temperature B, because the receiver had to wait longer. I am stuck right now, because I get different results every time I perform my solution + the results get distorted at the moment the link quality is not perfect and some packages are getting lost.
Is there a solution, maybe with a different setup, that helps me to prove the idea?If you want to measure deviations in the frequency of a clock, use a . This is what it's made for, and it can measure frequencies to a much higher degree of precision than your microcontroller could ever achieve.Generally speaking, most clock sources should be stable enough over a device's operating temperature range that differences in runtime should be negligible. If you're running your device at extreme enough temperatures that clock speeds are drifting by even a few percent, this is likely to prevent radios from operating, as their transmit/receive frequency will drift as well.You can send the messages with constant interval between them (e.g. every 5 milliseconds in A's time), and add a sequence number to the each messages. This way, you will know the expected time of each received message relative to the previous messages, even if some messages are missing.To measure the CPU speed, you don't really need to measure the time to receive and process each message. It will not be an objective measure anyway because a lot of the time in communication is actually spent on the actual reception, which is clocked from the radio clock, not from the one driving CPU. And if the CPU speed is really what you want to measure, don't use . You need to configure an msp430 hardware timer to be sourced from the DCO.Another option, if carrying out with your idea seems too complex, is to compare the DCO frequency with the frequency of the Low-Frequency crystal oscillator. This will not give the most accurate results, since the crystal is also affected by temperature, but is good enough if you want to measure the CPU speed to the accuracy of %, not ppm. See the function   to do it.The MSP430 typically has a free running internal oscillator that you program to give an approximate operating frequency for the processor clock.  This calibration alternates between two frequencies to give an approximation to the desired operating frequency.  Having looked at the circuit diagram for the telosB, it has a 32kHz crystal that can be used to provide a more accurate time source.  I am not familiar with the operating system or other software on the board that you are using but this 32kHz oscillator can be used as a calibration source for the main processor clock where the software uses an internal timer to calculate the actual main processor clock rate and tweaks the programmed clock frequency to bring it back to the desired frequency.  goes to a page in the TI MSP training material that describes the DCO operation and calibration.  If the OS includes this functionality then the drift in operating frequency with temperature will depend upon the 32kHz crystal characteristic and the frequency tracking algorithm.  It may well not be monotonic.There is also the software structure of the application sending the messages.  How is the decision to send the message triggered.  The normal method that I would use is to have a timer that uses the crystal to generate an event that triggers the main loop software to send out the message at a defined periodicity.  The main software then generates the message on the event.  Assuming that there are enough processor cycles between events to allow for the message generation then the actual clock frequency is irrelevant.You say that the link is not perfect and some of the messages are getting lost.  In both cases you are sending 100 messages in 500 ticks. The device cannot miss a transmission as it is the originator.  The difference in the received data times look like they could be due to the number of missed messages on the receive side.  You are sending one message every 5 OS ticks, presumably the receive interval is similar so you can detect missed messages if the time between any two messages is more than 6 ticks.Another thought; how is the OS tick generated.  If it is derived from the processor clock then the tick duration will change along with the processor clock.  If it is generated from the 32kHz XL1 oscillator then its period will vary with the crystal frequency characteristic.","My assumption was, that the frequency of a clock changes at different temperatures.

Assuming that there are enough processor cycles between events to allow for the message generation then the actual clock frequency is irrelevant.You say that the link is not perfect and some of the messages are getting lost.  In both cases you are sending 100 messages in 500 ticks. The device cannot miss a transmission as it is the originator.  The difference in the received data times look like they could be due to the number of missed messages on the receive side.  You are sending one message every 5 OS ticks, presumably the receive interval is similar so you can detect missed messages if the time between any two messages is more than 6 ticks.Another thought; how is the OS tick generated.  If it is derived from the processor clock then the tick duration will change along with the processor clock.  If it is generated from the 32kHz XL1 oscillator then its period will vary with the crystal frequency characteristic."

Windows 10 IoT Raspberry Pi 2: DHT22/AM2302,"I just wanted to start making experience with the DHT22/AM2302 (a temperature and humidity sensor), but I have no idea how to initialize and get the data of it ... I tried to use GpioPin:but get the exception: ""A resource required for this operation is disabled.""After that I took a look at the library for the unixoids and found this:But I have no idea how to realize that in VCSharp using Windows 10, anyone an idea or experience?Thank you very much in advance!UPDATE:I got the hint, that there is not GPIO-Pin 7 and this is true, so I re-tried it, but the GPIO-Output seems to be just HIGH or LOW ... So I have to use the I2C or the SPI ... According to this Project, I decided to try it out with SPI:  and making steps forward ... The difficulty now is to translate the above linked C-Library to the C-Sharp-SDK to receive the right data ... This works not so well, to be clear: It works just once on starting up the raspberry pi2, then starting / remote debugging the application, but after exiting the application and re-start them, the SPI Initialization fails.And now Im working on reading the data from the pin and will show some Code in a future update. Any comments, answers and or advices are still welcome. DHT22 requires very precise timing.  Although Raspberry PI/Windows 10 IoT core is extremely fast, since it's an operating system where other things need to happen unless you write some sort of low-level driver (not C#) you won't be able to generate the timings necessary to communicate with a DHT22.  What I do is use a cheap Arduino Mini Pro for about $5 with the sole purpose to generate and send the correct timings between the microcontroller and the Raspberry Pi, then setup some sort of communication channel between the Arduino Mini Pro (I2C, Serial) to pull the data from the Arduino.","DHT22 requires very precise timing.

Best practice to create automatic reports with Cumulocity,"I am wanting to create automated reports using the data I have collected with Cumulocity. I would like to automate the creation of the reports so that they aggregate accumulated timeseries, alarm & event data into a single report that could be automatically sent to relevant parties by e-mail on a fixed time interval (weekly, for example).I understand how to do this with the APIs that Cumulocity provides, but I am interested in experiences of more specific implementations (I imagine I am not the first person thinking about this). Should the data that I want to aggregate be retrieved with CEL (Cumulocity Event Language) and then the report created in the desired format (pdf) with my own script? Is it possible to host this kind of script in Cumulocity or do I have to host it myself?There is a quite new feature related to the reporting in cockpit (excel/csv export).

STMicro STMTouch Driver Usage of a 5 channel Mono electrode design for Linear Sensor Problems,"I'm working with a custom board which has 8 channels consisting of three touchkey and 1 linear sensor.There are 8 channel IOs, three sampling IOs and no shield configs.  Three of the channels are for the three touchkeys.  Five of the channels are for the linear sensor.I have worked with the STM3270B Discovery board where it has three channels setup in a Half-Ended electrode design (LIN_H).  I've worked through the example provided by this board for a non interrupt implementation.I have worked with the STM3207 Eval board where it has two channels setup as two touchkeys.On my custom board the touchkeys work flawlessly.  The five channel linear sensor does not work completely.   All five pads do indeed detect a touch but as far as data position goes, it fails.  The example has all the ios in a single channel.  There isn't an example I know of which uses 5 channels split across two TSC groups.   Its mentioned in the STMTouch Driver User Manual, but I'll have to look again for a code sample.The problem is that the macro which determines the value of the sensor LINEAR_POSITION = MyLinRots[0].p_Data->Position has two results.  If either of the two pads associated with the group 1 IOs is touched the DETECT macro fires correctly but the LINEAR_POSITION value is 0x2.  Likewise if the three pads associated with the group 2 IOS is touched DETECT macro fires correctly but the LINEAR_POSITION value is 0xC.  I thought the value would vary between 0 and 255 split 5 ways for each pad.  I've looked at the raw position instead of the scaled position but it behaves similarly.Here is my layout of the channels, banks, touchkeys, linear/rotary and objects split across the header file and source file.The header:The source file setting up the definitionsAny help is appreciated.Turns out linear sensors require a single io paired with a single sampling capacitor for each component of the sensor.  The problem above was that the hw was designed with five io's in two groups with two sampling capacitors.  The sampling cap in one group had 3 ios and in the other group it had 2 ios.I changed two three channel groups, each channel group had one io and one sampling cap.  Afterwards the code worked fine. I have encountered with this situation and I tried to find the solution in software instead of hardware. This problem is not a hardware problem, because, if you try to read channels that are in the same group and also in a same bank, the delta values will be same with each other.I think, your readings are as follows in STMStudio:  and .In order to solve this problem, you should separate your BANK_3 (LinRot Bank) as follows:The header file:The source file:The config file:Note: There is a limit of number of banks in the library. In my case, the number of banks that are required in my application was grater than the limit, then I just change the value and I haven't had any problem.The answer is a little bit late. But I hope it helps.Edit: I found a tip for Bank definition in ""UM1606 - STMTouch driver user manual"" document page 122. It is explained as follows:Summary: If same group I/Os can't be in a same bank and if all channels of a sensor should be in the same bank, then all channels of a sensor should belong to different group. Let's say the sensor is a 6-Channel linear sensor, then channels can be connected as follows: 1-Ch = Group1_IO1, 2-Ch = Group2_IO1, 3-Ch = Group3_IO1, 4-Ch = Group4_IO1, 5-Ch = Group5_IO1, 6-Ch = Group6_IO1.

  composing a linear or a rotary touch sensor must be acquired
  simultaneously. This means that all the channels must belong to the

  with channels belonging to different banks. A such configuration
  induces a loss of sensitivity and a higher noise level. Moreover,
  depending on the acquisition time, it is also possible to observe a
  position change when removing the finger from the sensor. For optimum performance of a linear or rotary sensor, all channels of
  such a sensor must be acquired simultaneously.Therefore all channels
  must belong to the same bank, which means the I/Os must be selected
  from different analog I/O groups. Please refer to datasheet for more
  information regarding I/O groups and available capacitive sensing

Memory Cleanup in OSGi,"I am learning OSGi as it is becoming popular now a days. I am using linux as my OS and OpenJDK as development environment.

I uninstalled the bundle B from OSGi and again checked the memory usage. I found the same result with no change either in CPU usage or in memory usage.I restarted the OSGi framework without bundle B then I found the below statisticsSo after this I came to know that uninstalling of bundle B from OSGi was not updating the memory or CPU usage until I restart the OSGi framework.  so can someone suggest me, how can I clean the memory after uninstallation of bundles in OSGi.Uninstalling a bundle will prevent other bundles from wiring to it (class loader management), but it will not unload existing instances from memory or stop activity in those classes. 
To unload an instance, it's the normal Java garbage collection process; you need to ensure that nothing else in your application is holding a reference to the instance, and then the garbage collector will free resources used by the instance.","Uninstalling a bundle will prevent other bundles from wiring to it (class loader management), but it will not unload existing instances from memory or stop activity in those classes.

This tutorial will be talking to your Arduino over Bluetooth.If you want to use TCP/IP communication (Ethernet / Wifi / etc.) you could create a sketch on the Arduino that listen incoming connection, here is a small example:  - and when a client connects you control the outputs with the usual functions (pinMode / digitalWrite).Then with Ionic (Angular to be precise) you can use the  functions or  (if you like the resource-way) to make GET requests to the Arduino IP (setup a static one, to keep it simple).And if you want to expand the system to something more complex you could use the Arduino Yun for example. It has an internal webserver already setup, used for the Arduino config. For a project I moved the internal CGI files (that serve the config interface) to offer my own interface.","Bluetooth is one of the most popular protocols for wireless communication between devices.

Can a Web application perform some action over Bluetooth?,"I'm sorry if this question sounds stupid, but I'm a complete noob to Web Development & Android Development. I'm working on a project that involves principles of IoT.I have this Arduino that I want to communicate with using both the Internet & the Bluetooth (in case there's no Internet). I have designed a Web application that can communicate with the Arduino over the Internet & I have also made the Web Application an Android app using . The button on the Web application is configured to communicate with the Arduino only using Internet. So when that same Web page is viewed in Android via WebView, the button works only if there's Internet. However, I also want  to be able to communicate with the Arduino over Bluetooth when both the app & Arduino are connected via Bluetooth.Is there any way I can configure the same button on Android app to work for Bluetooth without changing the configuration of the Button on the Web page??Thanks for your time.There are some advancements on connecting web browsers to BLE, as seen , but I believe for now the only consistent way is using native Android.You can still use the webview for the UI, but the BLE handling will be native. To make your html button call a native function, you can intercept the clicks using one of the solutions available in .If you instead use cordova (that would let you use your html view), there are plugins that allow Bluetooth communication using JavaScript, .","There are some advancements on connecting web browsers to BLE, as seen , but I believe for now the only consistent way is using native Android.You can still use the webview for the UI, but the BLE handling will be native.

Cumulocity data export,I noticed a limit of 2000 records per API call for getting collections out of Cumulocity. Will we be constrained to these limits or is there any other batch API available?You cannot get more than 2000 records for a single collection request at the moment. But you can specify a more direct query e.g. by time and grab it in multiple requests if it exceeds the 2000 records.Example:Another way would be to get data continuously pushed to you.

How do Internet-Of-Things apps detect if the device is local or not?,"Among other devices, I have a Belkin WeMo switch and a 3M WiFi Thermostat. Both come with Android apps. When I open the app when at home (phone on the same WiFi subnet as the devices) the app says the devices are ""local"", or that the app is connected ""directly"" to the device. Any change I make is then directly reflected on the device.If I connect from anywhere outside my house, it some how ""knows"" that the device is not local. If I understand correctly, it then updates its own server somewhere, and eventually the device at home gets the update.How does an app do that? I want to replicate that functionality.Basically, I have a Raspberry Pi that, let's say does something over GPIO and I can trigger that action by visiting a web page. On my home network, the web page is accessible at  ...Outside my home network, the web page is accessible at . I have set up my router to port forward 8080 on WAN to 192.168.10.25:80 on LAN. This works.How do I avoid having 2 pages? I want to write an app which effectively shows me the . When I am at home, it should ""automatically"" detect that the phone is on the same network as the URL, and just open  directly ... and when I am outside, it should ""automatically"" detect that too and launch . The key part here is that when at home, even if my ISP is down and host names aren't resolving, it shouldn't matter because everything is local.How do I go about doing this?Have your app try connecting to the Web server at 192.168.10.25 (or whatever local address you pick) first.  If there is no answer within a reasonable amount of time (5 seconds should be enough), then connect to the external webserver.For security, you might want to make sure that the webserver at 192.168.10.25 is actually your webserver.  You can do this by using challenge and response and public key encryption.  I can give more details if you wish.You can try to avoid waiting for the (non-existent) local webserver by looking at your phone's IP address.  If it isn't 192.168.x.y, you can assume that you are not local and go directly to the external web site.If you embed 192.168.10.25 directly in your app, then no host lookup is necessary.","Have your app try connecting to the Web server at 192.168.10.25 (or whatever local address you pick) first.

UWP - Get location coordinates explicitly via GPS Sensor in C#,"I'm working on UWP Application to get the GPS coordinates for Windows Device.
Normally UWP Location API fetch the location data from different sources like if there is GPS available, it will use GPS to get the location information other wise it will give results from Wifi and Other internet connection that is currently available.this is the code used to get location coordinates.// Wifi or GPS or Other Internet connectionMy device GPS is also available but all the result I'm getting through this code are based on Internet Wifi connection. 
Is there a way to set the location information source manually for the UWP app in C# to get all the information explicitly from GPS installed in Device ?
I've searched a lot but couldn't find the answer.I am not sure the driver of the GPS sensor you used provides the GPS data in the correct format to Geolocator. If not, you need to implement a driver for your specific GPS sensor, or communicate with the sensor via owned interface, or contact with the supplier. If the driver provides data in correct format to Geolocator, you need not to set the source.In location services architecture,the first layer of the location services architecture consists of hardware in the device.

Decoding a device payload sent to the Helium Console,"So I have defined an integration in the Helium Console (i.e. - an IoT LoRaWAN networking service). When I test out sending data from my IoT device to my Helium Console integration endpoint, I can see the payload. And I can manually decode it back to the JSON request body that's correct. But am having trouble defining a custom function in the Helium Console that will automate this for the integration. My IoT device is serializing a MsgPack payload of environmental data that's then sent to the Helium Console integration endpoint. And the Helium Console custom function allows Javascript, although just bare-bones without any requires, imports, etc.Below is the Python script that can manually decode the payload. If anyone is familiar with this area I'd be interested as to suggestions. There are pre-defined decoders available for Helium, although none that match exactly my hardware.If anyone has created custom decoding functions for Helium Console integrations I'd be curious as to how I could knock this out. Here is some info about this --> .Rather than reinvent the wheel, I modified the Arduino code running on my device.

Apache Flink: Multiple Window Aggregations and Late Data,"We plan to use Apache Flink with a huge IOT Setup. Customers are going to send us some kind of structured sensor data (like sensor_id, sensor_type, sensor_value, timestamp). We have no control when each customer sends this data, most likely in real-time, but we have no guarantee. We store all events in RabbitMQ/Kafka. UPDATE: We can assume that events per sensor come in order.Before starting implementing a possible streaming pipeline, we are interested in solutions for the following challenges:We store all raw sensor data into Cassandra. Further, we want to aggregate the sensor data by sensor_id on multiple time windows (e.g. 15 sek, 1 min, 15 min, 1 hour, 1 day). What is the recommended way to achieve the desired output efficiently with Flink streaming?As already mentioned we have no control over  the data is sent. For example, a customer might experience network failures and therefore data might arrive late. How is the recommended way to handle this? How can we use watermarking if we can only guarantee good watermarks by sensor_id (because each customer has its own time/issues/failures)? We can add some allowed lateness (like 6 - 12 hours or so), is that managable with flinks in memory window storage? What happens after this allowed lateness? Should we store the really late data into another kafka topic and doing batch processing continuously? Lastly, some customers upload csv files with their collected sensor data. Does this guide as well to an batch approach?What happens to a stream, when some customer send us data that is far in the future, due to misconfigured sensors (as we have no control over it)?We are curious about your recommendations. Thanks.These are quite a few questions. I'll try to answer them one by one:You can construct a data flow of cascading window operators and fork off (to emit or further processing) the result after each window.It seems the problem is rather that some data might arrive ""very"" late and not at the data is only in order per key. At the moment it is not possible to use per-key watermarks. So the ""logical clock"" is the same for all events. Flink's allowed lateness defines how long state is kept around to wait for late arriving data. If data arrives late (after a watermark) but within the allowed lateness, the corresponding state is still available and an update is computed. If an event is too late (later than allowed lateness) the state was discarded and the event is discarded as well. A high allowed lateness means that more state needs to be kept around. However, this issue can in principle be solved by scaling out. The processing of late data which goes into a dedicated Kafka topic can be done with Flink as well. Also periodic files can be better continuously processed with a stream processor. A batch solution needs to take care of data spanning files (externalizing state handling), scheduling of jobs, error handling, ...With Flink's watermark mechanism an operator always forwards its highest watermark (time cannot go backwards) but computes its watermark as the minimum watermark received from all input channels. So unless, you have future data on all channels, you should be fine. The future data would be put as state and will be computed when the time has reached ""the future"". That means, you won't lose data but you might have to wait for quite some time until it is processed.From your description, I would think about implementing the aggregation as a stateful FlatMap operator on a keyed stream. Given that the data per sensor arrives in order, you can do the necessary aggregations in a FlatMap (or a chain of FlatMaps, one for each time interval). One challenge here would be that you do not know when to close an aggregate until you see an event that is later than the aggregation interval. In streams with globally valid watermarks, the time can advance (and windows be closed) even if not event for a specific key is received.Another issue would be the removal of state in case a sensor is removed. This would not be automatically detected. Maybe a special marker record could be used to trigger the state clean-up.","These are quite a few questions.

Async Await operation blocking UI on return from another Frame,"I am new to c# and UWP, This is an assignment and I am on a strict deadline so haven't had time to figure things out completely, so excuse the messy code.
